Alberta to re-open K-to-12 schools in September with measures to limit the spread of COVID-19,"Jul 21, 2020","Alberta schools will open this September at near-normal operations with some health measures in place to help protect students and staff against COVID-19.,Education Minister Adriana LaGrange and Premier Jason Kenney made the announcement Tuesday afternoon at a COVID-19 briefing.,Kenney said he expects schools will do their best to follow guidelines developed by the government including reorganized classrooms to allow for physical distancing, strict stay-at-home policies if students or staff are sick, the use of hand sanitizer, frequent cleaning and staggered start times.,Students, staff and visitors will be expected to use a , daily to determine whether they can enter the school.,The government has also developed a re-entry tool kit to prepare parents and students for what to expect in the new school year. The kit includes videos for students, a guide for parents, frequently asked questions, school posters, a self-screening questionnaire in multiple languages and links to health guidelines.,LaGrange said that if a student or staff member test positive, the case will be investigated by health officials and parents will be informed if a case is confirmed in their school.,If there is an outbreak in a community or school the government could decide to transfer students to part-time classes or at home learning, she said.,If necessary, protocols will be adjusted based on the advice from the province’s chief medical officer of health.,Alberta classrooms have been closed since March 15 to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Districts were told to prepare for three potential scenarios for the upcoming school year: a return to near-normal, a partial reopening of schools, and a continuation of remote learning from home.,The government chose the option that allows the most potential physical contact despite a recent uptick in the number of COVID-19 cases in the province. Alberta reported 141 new cases on Monday. Over the weekend, there were 165 new cases on Friday, 106 on Saturday and 97 on Sunday.,The majority of active cases across Alberta are happening among those between the ages of 20 and 39.,Kenney said children and young people are at low risk of infection and severe health consequences. Only 14 per cent of Alberta cases are kids under 19, he said."
"Man who survived Icefield tour crash says driver joked about lack of seatbelts, noted vehicle speed","Jul 22, 2020","Moments before the Ice Explorer’s fatal roll at Columbia Icefield, the driver joked about how there weren’t any seatbelts and pointed to the vehicle’s speed as she pressed on the brakes, says a passenger.,Devon Ray Ernest was one of 27 people inside a vehicle operated by Pursuit that crashed during a tour of the Athabasca Glacier Saturday afternoon, killing three and critically injuring 14. A total of 24 people were injured.,His girlfriend of two years, Dionne Durocher, 24, from North Battleford died at the scene.,Ernest, Durocher and his cousin took the tour on the last day of their trip, which they planned as a belated birthday gift to him. The glacier tour was their last stop.,“Right when we got on the glacier tour bus, the driver said, ‘Fasten your seatbelts,’ and we all looked around us, trying look for seatbelts and there was nothing. And then a couple seconds later, she said, ‘We’re going to rely on the transmission to slow us down,’ ” he told Postmedia Tuesday.,He believes the vehicle was going too fast as the driver was pressing on the brakes when the front wheels started to slide.,“So we started going down, maybe two seconds to five seconds after that, I hear the front wheels slide off of the glacier, and then the last thing I saw was my body flying to the roof. So I held out my hands, and then I woke up, laying next to my girlfriend,” Ernest said.,“I kind of want to believe she is the one who woke me up … because her hand was on my leg, kind of cuddling me.”,A 28-year-old woman from Edmonton and a 58-year-old man from India also died in the crash. Their names have not been released.,Ernest believes seatbelts could have saved their lives.,Pursuit did not respond to a request for comment by press deadline, but in a statement to The Canadian Press said vehicles don’t have seatbelts because they aren’t approved to run on highways and don’t go faster than 40 km/h.,“Once the investigation is complete, we will take every recommendation into careful consideration for future operations,” communications manager Tanya Otis wrote in an email.,Ernest was discharged from Edmonton’s Royal Alexandra Hospital,Tuesday with a concussion, more than 10 stitches each in his head and hand, a fractured wrist and other bruises and cuts. He said Pursuit has not reached out to him.,Ernest described his girlfriend as caring person who loved her family and the planet.,“She would always cuddle me whenever I felt sad. The most loving person ever,” he said. “I’m so sad right now.”,Durocher’s family said she was a gentle and loving person, and she wanted to join the army.,“Even though she’s tiny, she wants to reach big goals,” Rose Durocher, her aunt, told Postmedia Tuesday.,“She was very loving, caring, compassionate to others, especially in her family, and her mom … she has a lot of friends because of her special personality.”,Her parents did not want to speak to media, but her father John Ronnie Durocher Sr. wrote a poem for her obituary, according to Rose Durocher.,“I love you from the bottom of my heart, always brightens up my day with that perfect smile. Your happiness puts a song in my heart, that is why you will always be my one and only sweetheart,” reads the poem.,RCMP said they expected the vehicle to be removed from the scene by Tuesday night.,Police have said the rocky terrain and the extent of damage to the large vehicle make it difficult to remove it without compromising the crash investigation.,Cpl. Deanna Fontaine said police hired contractors, including heavy equipment operators, to help remove the vehicle, which would require “modifying the landscape” to build a temporary road.,“We are getting the assistance of qualified people, proper equipment … so we’re able to continue with our investigation in a manner that protects the integrity of the evidence involved, and the safety of all involved,” she said Tuesday.,Pursuit’s website describes the Ice Explorer vehicle as a 3.86 metres tall, 13 metres long and 3.6 metres wide. The off-road tour buses are painted red and white, and have six large monster truck-style wheels."
Edmonton police investigating racist images posted in canine unit locker room,"Jul 22, 2020","Investigators with the Edmonton police Professional Standards Branch are looking into a pair of images posted in the canine unit locker room containing racist caricatures of Black and Indigenous people.,Postmedia obtained photographs of the images, taken earlier this month.,One shows what appears to be a minstrel-show-style Zulu warrior in front of a cutout of a police dog, below the words “Buddy’s First Get em! Get em!” (Buddy is an Edmonton police dog.),Another image features the cover of the children’s book ,, with the titular character saying “Beny will never find me in here!!” (Beny is also a police dog.),Edmonton police confirmed the images are being investigated.,Police did not say who created or posted the images.,Jibril Ibrahim, president of the Somali Canadian Cultural Society of Edmonton and co-chair of the EPS ,, called the images “disturbing.”,“I was hoping that we learned a lesson from what is happening at this moment,” he said. “But … if they are putting those kinds of things (on) their own lockers, that creates kind of a feeling within the community that EPS is out there to get them.”,“It shows a lack of respect,” he added.,Ibrahim echoed calls — supported by , — to create an independent, third-party organization like the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) to investigate Police Act misconduct.,Richard Mirasty, an Edmonton defence lawyer who is Cree, has had several clients injured by police dogs.,“In a police station, where … a good percentage of the people that they interact with on a daily basis are BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of colour), to have this in the locker room of a police officer is unacceptable and should not be tolerated.”,“Some might say this is sort of benign, and not harmful, and it’s just boys being boys, but it’s just really unacceptable behaviour in today’s climate,” he added. “And really it was never acceptable.”,Micki Ruth, chair of the Edmonton Police Commission, said the commission was earlier made aware of the images and alerted McFee, who by then knew about the posters.,“In order to have an effective and efficient police service, it’s got to be one that does not subject its own members, let alone anybody else, to any kind of harassment or discrimination,” she said. “The two just don’t go together.”,She said so far, the commission is satisfied with the service’s response. “We’ll continue to follow up,” she added.,The canine unit is based out of a kennel facility located near the former municipal airport. It includes 12 dog teams, who specialize in tracking suspects.,According to the police commission’s ,, which provides statistics on use of force incidents, police dogs were present at 511 incidents last year and came into “contact” with a person on 89 occasions.,The PSB investigates misconduct allegations against officers. The police chief has the ultimate say over whether to charge an officer under the provincial Police Act and send a case to a formal hearing.,An officer can be charged with a variety of Police Act offences — including discreditable conduct, insubordination and deceit — and can face reprimands, pay cuts, reductions in rank and even dismissal if convicted."
"COVID-19: Hinshaw expresses concern over rise in cases as 141 reported, two more deaths","Jul 22, 2020","Alberta’s chief medical officer of health again expressed concern over the rising number of COVID-19 cases Tuesday as the province reported 141 new cases and two deaths.,Over the past few days, the number of new cases has been in the triple digits, with Sunday being the exception. The vast majority are among those between the ages of 20 and 39. To date, the total number of active cases in the province is 1,193.,The latest deaths happened in the Calgary and Edmonton Zones, bringing the provincial total to 172.,During the Tuesday update, Dr. Deena Hinshaw said the province is watching the situation closely.,“I am concerned by the continued rise in active cases,” she said. “We know that it is possible that new cases could spike in a very rapid way once it reaches that tipping point where you have enough new cases with enough contacts. I don’t think we’ve crossed that tipping point.”,Premier Jason Kenney, who was also at the update to announce ,, pleaded with Albertans to continue to follow health guidelines, including physically distancing.,“The last thing we want to do is reimpose damaging restrictions on our economy and our freedoms,” he said. “COVID-19 is not over and it likely won’t be over for months to come. Let me be blunt. If you think you can socialize with large groups of people in close quarters, knock it off. If you’re young and healthy, remember you could still carry and transmit the virus that ends up killing someone who is old and vulnerable.”,One of the two deaths reported Tuesday is linked to the outbreak at Edmonton’s Good Samaritan Southgate Care Centre.,Alberta Health said in an email a woman in her 70s died in connection to the outbreak at the long-term care home, which was declared on June 13. This brings the total death count to four. All were residents at the home. To date, there are 43 active cases among residents and 11 among staff. Five people have recovered so far.,The other death was a woman in her 80s in the Calgary Zone.,On a positive note, Hinshaw said the province has seen an improvement in people following public health guidelines at beaches after issues of overcrowding surfaced two weeks ago.,Last week that changed thanks to the efforts in communities like Sylvan Lake and Chestermere, Hinshaw said.,“We had very few reports of issues at beaches across the province last week,” she said. “The future is up to us and we can change it. Just like how we worked together to address the specific issue of beach overcrowding, we can address other issues, limit the spread of the virus, lower our daily case numbers.”,Ninety-three people in Alberta are in hospital because of COVID-19, 16 of which are in intensive care. To date, 8,363 people have recovered. The province has also completed nearly 600,000 tests.,There have been 7,728 total cases in Alberta.,In Canada, there have been 111,697 confirmed cases and 8,857 deaths, according to the ,.

"Edmonton's CFL football team to discontinue use of 'Eskimos' name, will gather public feedback on new name","Jul 22, 2020","Edmonton’s CFL football team will no longer be known as the Eskimos, as the club has decided to discontinue the name after feedback from Inuit communities.,Board of directors chairwoman Janice Agrios made the official announcement Tuesday afternoon following weeks of increasing pressure to change the derogatory name, which was adopted by the football club more than 100 years ago in an effort to honour the toughness and resiliency of Canada’s Inuit people. Postmedia first reported on the name change ,.,The team will be known as the EE Football Team and the Edmonton Football Team while a public engagement process is conducted for a new name.,A survey on the former name launched by the club in early July in response to the public calls for change found a clear shift in views from previous community consultations over the past three years. The team also lost sponsorship support from Boston Pizza and , with the team if the name wasn’t changed.,“I think that most people will say that the whole world has changed in the last few months. The engagement and the surveys that we’ve done over the last several weeks in response to current discussions clearly demonstrated that perspectives regarding the name are changing and we made the decision to change the name as a result of this input,” Agrios said Tuesday during a news conference.,“Our most recent opinion research shows plainly that views are shifting quickly. People who defended the name only a year ago are less comfortable with it now.”,Back in February, the team decided to,, Agrios said. Results from the previous engagement released by Agrios last Wednesday showed 78 per cent of Western Arctic Inuit respondents opposed a name change while 55 per cent of Inuit in Nunavut were against it. But Canada’s national Inuit organization, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK), has vocally supported a new name.,ITK welcomed the announcement Tuesday, saying ongoing use of the team name is damaging to Inuit people and reconciliation.,“The process of recognizing and responding to these harmful effects is key to reconciliation between Inuit and Canada, and contributes to the monumental work required to dismantle systemic racism,” the organization said in a statement posted to its website. “ITK is grateful for the vocal support that has contributed to bring about this decision — from Inuit youth to corporate sponsors and Canadian citizens who saw an injustice and felt compelled to speak out. Your voices have brought us here.”,Club president and CEO Chris Presson said he is hopeful the renaming process will be complete when the team returns to home turf at Commonwealth Stadium. If a modified season takes place this summer in a bubble format, Presson said a new team name won’t be finalized by that time and isn’t clear what jerseys would be worn.,The club will pick a new name with the goal of allowing the “EE” logo and green-and-gold colour scheme to continue, Presson said.,“I can tell you that we sure love our green and gold and our double ‘E.’ It’s early days, but we hope to keep that iconic logo,” he said. “We understand the meaning of those colours and the emblem to our fans and to our community and we certainly don’t want to upset that.”,Although the quest for a new name is in its early stages, Presson said the club plans to include Inuit communities in the decision and also involve fans.,Aaron Paquette, Edmonton’s only Indigenous city councillor, said the team’s decision is a big step forward and he is hopeful the new name will honour the area’s Inuit community. The city’s naming committee is in the process of determining Indigenous names for the 12 new wards in the next election.,“Nothing really says that everyone is welcome more than deciding to end a century of a problematic name and move forward in a good way with collaboration of all the affected communities,” he said. “Nothing changes about the history of the team, but more people can be welcomed into the fandom. It’s a win for everyone.”,Mayor Don Iveson took to social media minutes after the announcement to share his support for the decision. Back in November 2017, Iveson , after Métis Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman said it is time for a more inclusive name.,“"

Alberta technology projects to receive $58.4 million in Natural Gas Challenge,"Jul 21, 2020","Using artificial intelligence and machine learning to measure and locate methane emissions, and producing compressed natural gas for vehicles are two of the 20 projects getting a combined $58.4 million from the government through Emissions Reduction Alberta.,The Alberta government announced the finalists of the Natural Gas Challenge on Tuesday. The funding, , comes from the Technology Innovation Emissions Reduction (TIER) program, paid for by a carbon tax on large emitters.,Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA) said it received 117 applications and chose, Among them are Edmonton and Capital Power, which will get $10 million to upgrade landfill gas at Clover Bar Landfill and inject it into Alberta’s natural gas system as renewable natural gas., will get $5 million to work with an oil and gas operation to build a modular farming system to grow crops, and ATCO Gas and Pipelines will get $7.9 million to produce renewable natural gas to be sold and used within the province in compressed natural gas fleet vehicles and commercial applications., will get $4 million to use artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to better measure emissions.,Environment and Parks Minister Jason Nixon said the projects are estimated to be worth $155 million along with private investment.,“This is a real testament to the type of ingenuity and skills associated with this challenge in our province,” Nixon said at an ERA webinar event.,If successful, the projects will lead to cumulative greenhouse gas reductions of almost one million tonnes of CO2 by 2030 — equivalent to the GHG emissions from 750,000 passenger vehicles driven for one year — according to the ERA.,Associate minister of natural gas and electricity Dale Nally said the funding was critical to helping offset higher capital costs, attracting investment and keeping Alberta industries competitive.,The government said it anticipates these projects will deliver approximately 760 new jobs."
Alberta Medical Association holding confidence vote on health minister as dispute over pay continues,"Jul 21, 2020","The Alberta Medical Association is asking its member physicians to vote on whether they have enough confidence in Health Minister Tyler Shandro to continue trying to negotiate a compensation agreement with him.,The association’s president, Dr. Christine Molnar, released a statement Tuesday saying it made the “unprecedented decision” because the physician community is in deep distress.,“After experiencing months of anxiety in the toxic environment that the minister’s actions have created, combined with shrinking practice revenue and the COVID-19 crisis, many physicians are wondering how they will continue,” she said.,The move to gather input will decide what the AMA does next in the ongoing impasse between doctors and the provincial government.,“This vote isn’t symbolism. It’s about action,” said Dr. Molnar.,Shandro’s press secretary, Steve Buick, said in a statement the government has a mandate to reduce wait times and make the health system more efficient.,“That is exactly what we are doing. An online survey of a comparatively small number of the highest earners does not change that,” said Buick.,If members express confidence in the Minister, then the AMA will continue to try to work with him, Molnar said.,But if its members decide they do not have confidence in Shandro, the AMA will ask Premier Jason Kenney to intervene to restart contract talks or appoint an independent third-party arbitrator. In its statement, the AMA said it would not demand that Shandro be fired.,“And if the premier is unable or unwilling to address the issue, then there really is only one higher authority to whom we can appeal — the public, our patients — and that’s where we will need to concentrate our efforts,” said Molnar. The AMA’s vote will be , until July 28.,NDP health critic David Shepherd said Tuesday the government was being dismissive and insulting, and noted many staff in the premier’s office earn higher salaries than some family doctors.,“This government would be well served to sit down and actually listen to the voices of front line doctors,” said Shepherd.,The AMA’s move was a very clear public indictment of Shandro’s handling of the health file, Shepherd said, standing by his call that the minister needs to be removed if he is not able to negotiate a deal.,“They need to find somebody who is able to do that work without the level of destruction that we’ve seen him bring,” Shepherd said.,In February, Shandro ripped up , with doctors after negotiations broke down. The AMA said it presented cost-saving offers to the government in February, March, and on July 1, while Shandro has repeatedly said he is open to credible proposals.,An AMA survey recently found that , were considering leaving Alberta.

"Mixed bag for farmers as 2020 growing season marked by hail, rain","Jul 21, 2020","Some Alberta farmers are looking forward to one of the best harvests they’ve had in years while other farmers are anticipating one of the worst, thanks to the mixed bag of weather conditions the province has experienced thus far in 2020.,According to the Alberta government’s most recent ,, dated July 14, crops across the province are doing better than the five-year average in most regions. Provincially, crop growing conditions are rated 78 per cent good to excellent, compared to the five-year average of 64 per cent.,That’s good news for farmers like Dave Bishop, who grows barley, wheat, canola and peas in the southern part of the province, near the village of Barons, east of Claresholm. After , or near-drought conditions in the region, Bishop said his crops are looking good.,“It’s been dry for the last few years, but this year we’ve had more than our share of rain so the crops are generally looking terrific,” Bishop said. “We’re looking forward to this year’s harvest, because we’re actually going to have some crop to harvest.”,But not all producers are so lucky. Outside of southern Alberta, regions that weren’t suffering for a lack of moisture prior to this summer are now dealing with way too much due to persistent rain. According to the provincial crop report, soil moisture reserves are near normal or higher for more than 95 per cent of the province, with some wet areas in the central, northeast, northwest and Peace regions experiencing soil moisture levels at or near 50-year highs.,In some areas, fields are soaked with standing water while pastures are flooding and dying off. In the northwest part of the province, for example, crop conditions are rated 31 per cent below the five-year average.,“Our crops here are not very good,” said John Guelly, who farms in the Westlock area in central Alberta. “The ground is so saturated that the roots just can’t get any oxygen. A lot of the crop has just been choked right off. What is there is very sparse and spindly … it’s going to make harvest more of a recovery effort than a harvest.”,Guelly added his farm has had about 30 centimetres of rain since the beginning of May, which is not an excessive amount, but the ground was already waterlogged from last year’s rainy summer and fall and then this winter’s heavy snowpack. He said last year, harvest in his area was so wet that combines were leaving muddy ruts in the fields.,“This will be our fifth bad year, for one reason or another. We had the smoke from the forest fires a couple years ago which delayed crop maturity, and then last year’s late harvest,” he said. “It’s just been one thing after another. We keep hoping to get back to a normal year.”,At her family’s farm near Acme, Tara Sawyer is also wishing for a “normal” year. The fields on the Sawyer farm were ravaged by the same , that wreaked havoc upon homes and businesses in northeast Calgary.,“It got 100 per cent of our crops. They’re starting to recover now, but we certainly have a lot of damage,” she said. “The canola took the worst of it; it doesn’t bounce back as well.”,Sawyer said while most of the crop will be salvageable, they will need some hot, sunny weather to help them catch up to where they would have been without the storm damage. And regardless of how the rest of the season goes, Sawyer’s crop has lost significant value.,“You know you don’t have the control, you know it’s Mother Nature, but that still doesn’t make it feel any better,” Sawyer said. “It’s disheartening for a day or two, but then you have to start thinking about what you’re going to do to rally back.”,Twitter: "
"Braid: As COVID-19 soars again, Kenney says kids will be safe in schools this fall","Jul 22, 2020","By any measure, Alberta is no longer doing well with this pandemic. Infections are rising. The count jumped sharply again Monday, with 141 new cases.,Over four days since last Friday, the total is 509 new infections. Health authorities expect this to get worse before (or if) this new surge is controlled.,Altogether, Tuesday was one strange day for the UCP government to roll out plans for a ,.,First, Premier Jason Kenney said the new spike is very concerning and almost begged people to wear masks, comply with social distancing and keep gatherings small.,“I plead with Albertans not to give up on the progress that we’ve made,” he said. “The last thing we want to have to do is re-impose damaging restrictions on our economy and our freedoms.,“COVID-19 is not over. And it likely won’t be over for months to come.,“If you think you can socialize with large groups of people in closed quarters, knock it off!”,Calgary council stepped in Tuesday with a surprise bylaw to ,, effective Aug. 1.,But Kenney was giving his own clear warning that a continuing surge of cases could mean more closings in the province.,And then came one of the weirdest switches on record.,Kenney, along with Education Minister Adriana LaGrange and public health chief Dr. Deena Hinshaw, went on to argue that it’s safe to reopen schools.,The premier said studies and experience in other countries prove that children have a low rate of infection and don’t get serious cases of the disease.,“The evidence is overwhelming that schools can be operated safely with little health risk for children and teachers, and low risk of causing serious outbreaks in the communities that surround them.,“The younger the child, the lower the risk,” he said, adding that young kids don’t transmit the disease the way adults do.,Kenney cited successful school openings in Europe, especially Denmark, and also mentioned B.C.’s decision to briefly reopen schools in June.,So, that was the premier’s case. It reminded me uncomfortably of his assertion in May that homeless people have “a very high level of immune resistance, of immunity, and resilience against an influenza of this nature.”,Actually, experts say the homeless have lower infection rates because they spend so much time outdoors and often roam alone or in small groups.,In any case, we can only hope he’s right about safety in the schools, because the alternative is suffering and incalculable social disruption. The initial explosion of protest on social media showed he’s got a lot of convincing to do.,Kenney was backed in his views by both LaGrange and Hinshaw, although I thought the doctor was more reticent.,“I want to stress there is no risk-free approach to living with COVID-19,” Hinshaw said. “We still have to learn to live with it. There are no easy places in front of us.”,She agreed that kids usually have mild disease and don’t transmit as readily, but then added:,“Despite this, COVID-19 still needs to be taken seriously … we will almost certainly identify cases of COVID-19 in students and staff in the fall.” The task, she added, will be to “limit onward spread.”,The government won’t make kids wear masks. With young ones especially, they’d likely come off for use as slingshots. Teachers won’t be forced to wear masks either.,Altogether, this is optimism wrapped in hope and sealed with a prayer.,Kenney is right when he says closed schools mean delayed education and severe social challenges for both kids and families. Our whole society is geared to having children in school 10 months a year.,But this will be extremely difficult for the schools, the parents, the kids and especially teachers. They face a maze of new rules that will make school life immensely more complex and stressful.,Good luck to them all. May Kenney’s COVID-free bubble descend upon them.,Twitter: ,Facebook: "
"Skateboarding pros take sport, along with message of hope, to Indigenous youth","Jul 21, 2020","Believing it saved them from taking the wrong path, a group of avid skateboarders is touring Alberta reserves to share their sport with Indigenous youth.,“Skateboarding has given us so much. We just want to spread the message. We don’t want to see more youth struggle with mental health, suicide. We want them to be happy, active and empowered,” said Rose Archie, one of the organizers of Nations Skate Youth.,The group of five includes two former Calgary brothers — Tristan and Dustin Henry who grew up skateboarding at Millennium Park — along with Joe Buffalo from Alberta’s Maskwacis reserve, Adam George from Ontario, and Archie from the interior of B.C. Both Dustin and Buffalo are pro riders: Dustin is with the Altimers Skateboards team, which has travelled to Los Angeles for videos, and Buffalo with Colonialism Skateboards out of Regina.,Archie said the project came about after a panel discussion in February promoting social change and mental health among Indigenous youth. All of the members know each other from skateboarding in Vancouver, where they now live, and each has their own reasons for taking part, from personal experience with racism to overcoming harm from residential schools.,“Mental health is close to me because my sister had an accidental suicide. It had me looking at the suicide rates on reserves. I heard people say my sister was just a statistic,” said Archie.,“My message to youth is that their voice is important. They need to be proud of who they are,” said Archie, 38, who has been skateboarding since 1992 and has taught girls’ lessons for the past seven years. She became involved with community work after struggling for years with her identity after growing up on a reserve.,“I was kind of ashamed of being Indigenous. I just want to give others hope.”,Buffalo grew up in the residential school system and he felt skateboarding helped him survive. “It taught me perseverance, taught me how to tolerate a lot of things. It’s definitely been a helpful tool to help me navigate through life,” he told a Fort St. John TV station that reported on the group’s visit there.,To support the visit to five reserves and a wrap-up talk in Red Deer, Archie created a , which is close to doubling its goal of $10,000. The proceeds will support the trip and help purchase some gear for the kids. They have also received some donated skateboards, helmets and shoes that they will leave in some of the communities they visit.,Beyond inspiring youth to take up a sport they all say is in their blood, Archie said the five are hoping to encourage reserves to build skateparks or at least make a start by creating ramps and other obstacles.,“I was hitchhiking one and a half to two hours to skateboard and I was 14. If there had been a park on the reserve, I would have been doing it there.”,Nations Skate Youth has visited Tsuut’ina Nation and Morley this week, and moves on to Maskwacis on July 23, Enoch Cree Nation July 24, Alexis Nakota Sioux Nation July 25 and Red Deer on July 26."
Parks Canada officials confirm euthanized wolf was behind Egypt Lake Campground incident,"Jul 21, 2020","The young, male wolf that was killed earlier this month due to its concerning behaviour near Sunshine Village is confirmed to be the same wolf responsible for entering multiple tents at the Egypt Lake Campground, according to Parks Canada officials.,At the beginning of July, the wolf had demonstrated food-conditioned behaviour near Sunshine Village and staff reported seeing it near Sunshine Road. Parks Canada staff captured the wolf while it was entering a storage building and an examination found the wolf had an “excessive level of habituation and human food conditioning,” which made it too dangerous to be released.,The wolf was euthanized and DNA samples were taken to compare its DNA to samples taken from Egypt Lake Campground, only 13 kilometres from the Sunshine sightings, where a wolf had entered multiple tents, leaving its DNA behind.,Parks Canada said in a statement Tuesday that the DNA results confirm the euthanized wolf was also responsible for the Egypt Lake Campground incident. As a result, the , in the Egypt Lake area have been lifted.,In an ,, Bill Hunt, resource conservation manager with Parks Canada, said the male wolf and a second wolf that was also euthanized this month were not known to park officials who closely monitor the Bow Valley pack. He said it’s a mystery where the two wolves originated from.,“This is highly unusual,” said Hunt. “Around the town of Banff, the last time we’ve had to do this was in 2016. So it’s odd these two incidents occurred within the same week. We can’t always speculate what that’s about.”,Parks Canada is reminding visitors and residents to do their part to protect the wolves in Banff National Park by always securing food and garbage, never feeding wildlife and reporting all wolf sightings to Banff Dispatch at 403-762-1470.,Twitter: "

Districts were told to prepare for three potential scenarios for the upcoming school year: a return to near-normal, a partial reopening of schools, and a continuation of remote learning from home.,The government chose the option that allows the most potential physical contact despite a recent uptick in the number of COVID-19 cases in the province. Alberta reported 141 new cases on Monday. Over the weekend, there were 165 new cases on Friday, 106 on Saturday and 97 on Sunday.,The majority of active cases across Alberta are happening among those between the ages of 20 and 39.,Kenney said children and young people are at low risk of infection and severe health consequences. Only 14 per cent of Alberta cases are kids under 19, he said."
Edmonton police investigating racist images posted in canine unit locker room,"Jul 22, 2020","Investigators with the Edmonton police Professional Standards Branch are looking into a pair of images posted in the canine unit locker room containing racist caricatures of Black and Indigenous people.,Postmedia obtained photographs of the images, taken earlier this month.,One shows what appears to be a minstrel-show-style Zulu warrior in front of a cutout of a police dog, below the words “Buddy’s First Get em! Get em!” (Buddy is an Edmonton police dog.),Another image features the cover of the children’s book ,, with the titular character saying “Beny will never find me in here!!” (Beny is also a police dog.),Edmonton police confirmed the images are being investigated.,Police did not say who created or posted the images.,Jibril Ibrahim, president of the Somali Canadian Cultural Society of Edmonton and co-chair of the EPS ,, called the images “disturbing.”,“I was hoping that we learned a lesson from what is happening at this moment,” he said. “But … if they are putting those kinds of things (on) their own lockers, that creates kind of a feeling within the community that EPS is out there to get them.”,“It shows a lack of respect,” he added.,Ibrahim echoed calls — supported by , — to create an independent, third-party organization like the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) to investigate Police Act misconduct.,Richard Mirasty, an Edmonton defence lawyer who is Cree, has had several clients injured by police dogs.,“In a police station, where … a good percentage of the people that they interact with on a daily basis are BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of colour), to have this in the locker room of a police officer is unacceptable and should not be tolerated.”,“Some might say this is sort of benign, and not harmful, and it’s just boys being boys, but it’s just really unacceptable behaviour in today’s climate,” he added. “And really it was never acceptable.”,Micki Ruth, chair of the Edmonton Police Commission, said the commission was earlier made aware of the images and alerted McFee, who by then knew about the posters.,“In order to have an effective and efficient police service, it’s got to be one that does not subject its own members, let alone anybody else, to any kind of harassment or discrimination,” she said. “The two just don’t go together.”,She said so far, the commission is satisfied with the service’s response. “We’ll continue to follow up,” she added.,The canine unit is based out of a kennel facility located near the former municipal airport. It includes 12 dog teams, who specialize in tracking suspects.,According to the police commission’s ,, which provides statistics on use of force incidents, police dogs were present at 511 incidents last year and came into “contact” with a person on 89 occasions.,The PSB investigates misconduct allegations against officers. The police chief has the ultimate say over whether to charge an officer under the provincial Police Act and send a case to a formal hearing.,An officer can be charged with a variety of Police Act offences — including discreditable conduct, insubordination and deceit — and can face reprimands, pay cuts, reductions in rank and even dismissal if convicted."
"Edmonton's CFL football team to discontinue use of 'Eskimos' name, will gather public feedback on new name","Jul 22, 2020","Edmonton’s CFL football team will no longer be known as the Eskimos, as the club has decided to discontinue the name after feedback from Inuit communities.,Board of directors chairwoman Janice Agrios made the official announcement Tuesday afternoon following weeks of increasing pressure to change the derogatory name, which was adopted by the football club more than 100 years ago in an effort to honour the toughness and resiliency of Canada’s Inuit people. Postmedia first reported on the name change ,.,The team will be known as the EE Football Team and the Edmonton Football Team while a public engagement process is conducted for a new name.,A survey on the former name launched by the club in early July in response to the public calls for change found a clear shift in views from previous community consultations over the past three years. The team also lost sponsorship support from Boston Pizza and , with the team if the name wasn’t changed.,“I think that most people will say that the whole world has changed in the last few months. The engagement and the surveys that we’ve done over the last several weeks in response to current discussions clearly demonstrated that perspectives regarding the name are changing and we made the decision to change the name as a result of this input,” Agrios said Tuesday during a news conference.,“Our most recent opinion research shows plainly that views are shifting quickly. People who defended the name only a year ago are less comfortable with it now.”,Back in February, the team decided to,, Agrios said. Results from the previous engagement released by Agrios last Wednesday showed 78 per cent of Western Arctic Inuit respondents opposed a name change while 55 per cent of Inuit in Nunavut were against it. But Canada’s national Inuit organization, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK), has vocally supported a new name.,ITK welcomed the announcement Tuesday, saying ongoing use of the team name is damaging to Inuit people and reconciliation.,“The process of recognizing and responding to these harmful effects is key to reconciliation between Inuit and Canada, and contributes to the monumental work required to dismantle systemic racism,” the organization said in a statement posted to its website. “ITK is grateful for the vocal support that has contributed to bring about this decision — from Inuit youth to corporate sponsors and Canadian citizens who saw an injustice and felt compelled to speak out. Your voices have brought us here.”,Club president and CEO Chris Presson said he is hopeful the renaming process will be complete when the team returns to home turf at Commonwealth Stadium. If a modified season takes place this summer in a bubble format, Presson said a new team name won’t be finalized by that time and isn’t clear what jerseys would be worn.,The club will pick a new name with the goal of allowing the “EE” logo and green-and-gold colour scheme to continue, Presson said.,“I can tell you that we sure love our green and gold and our double ‘E.’ It’s early days, but we hope to keep that iconic logo,” he said. “We understand the meaning of those colours and the emblem to our fans and to our community and we certainly don’t want to upset that.”,Although the quest for a new name is in its early stages, Presson said the club plans to include Inuit communities in the decision and also involve fans.,Aaron Paquette, Edmonton’s only Indigenous city councillor, said the team’s decision is a big step forward and he is hopeful the new name will honour the area’s Inuit community. The city’s naming committee is in the process of determining Indigenous names for the 12 new wards in the next election.,“Nothing really says that everyone is welcome more than deciding to end a century of a problematic name and move forward in a good way with collaboration of all the affected communities,” he said. “Nothing changes about the history of the team, but more people can be welcomed into the fandom. It’s a win for everyone.”,Mayor Don Iveson took to social media minutes after the announcement to share his support for the decision. Back in November 2017, Iveson , after Métis Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman said it is time for a more inclusive name.,“"
"COVID-19: Hinshaw expresses concern over rise in cases as 141 reported, two more deaths","Jul 22, 2020","Alberta’s chief medical officer of health again expressed concern over the rising number of COVID-19 cases Tuesday as the province reported 141 new cases and two deaths.,Over the past few days, the number of new cases has been in the triple digits, with Sunday being the exception. The vast majority are among those between the ages of 20 and 39. To date, the total number of active cases in the province is 1,193.,The latest deaths happened in the Calgary and Edmonton Zones, bringing the provincial total to 172.,During the Tuesday update, Dr. Deena Hinshaw said the province is watching the situation closely.,“I am concerned by the continued rise in active cases,” she said. “We know that it is possible that new cases could spike in a very rapid way once it reaches that tipping point where you have enough new cases with enough contacts. I don’t think we’ve crossed that tipping point.”,Premier Jason Kenney, who was also at the update to announce ,, pleaded with Albertans to continue to follow health guidelines, including physically distancing.,“The last thing we want to do is reimpose damaging restrictions on our economy and our freedoms,” he said. “COVID-19 is not over and it likely won’t be over for months to come. Let me be blunt. If you think you can socialize with large groups of people in close quarters, knock it off. If you’re young and healthy, remember you could still carry and transmit the virus that ends up killing someone who is old and vulnerable.”,One of the two deaths reported Tuesday is linked to the outbreak at Edmonton’s Good Samaritan Southgate Care Centre.,Alberta Health said in an email a woman in her 70s died in connection to the outbreak at the long-term care home, which was declared on June 13. This brings the total death count to four. All were residents at the home. To date, there are 43 active cases among residents and 11 among staff. Five people have recovered so far.,The other death was a woman in her 80s in the Calgary Zone.,On a positive note, Hinshaw said the province has seen an improvement in people following public health guidelines at beaches after issues of overcrowding surfaced two weeks ago.,Last week that changed thanks to the efforts in communities like Sylvan Lake and Chestermere, Hinshaw said.,“We had very few reports of issues at beaches across the province last week,” she said. “The future is up to us and we can change it. Just like how we worked together to address the specific issue of beach overcrowding, we can address other issues, limit the spread of the virus, lower our daily case numbers.”,Ninety-three people in Alberta are in hospital because of COVID-19, 16 of which are in intensive care. To date, 8,363 people have recovered. The province has also completed nearly 600,000 tests.,There have been 7,728 total cases in Alberta.,In Canada, there have been 111,697 confirmed cases and 8,857 deaths, according to the ,.

"Man who survived Icefield tour crash says driver joked about lack of seatbelts, noted vehicle speed","Jul 22, 2020","Moments before the Ice Explorer’s fatal roll at Columbia Icefield, the driver joked about how there weren’t any seatbelts and pointed to the vehicle’s speed as she pressed on the brakes, says a passenger.,Devon Ray Ernest was one of 27 people inside a vehicle operated by Pursuit that crashed during a tour of the Athabasca Glacier Saturday afternoon, killing three and critically injuring 14. A total of 24 people were injured.,His girlfriend of two years, Dionne Durocher, 24, from North Battleford died at the scene.,Ernest, Durocher and his cousin took the tour on the last day of their trip, which they planned as a belated birthday gift to him. The glacier tour was their last stop.,“Right when we got on the glacier tour bus, the driver said, ‘Fasten your seatbelts,’ and we all looked around us, trying look for seatbelts and there was nothing. And then a couple seconds later, she said, ‘We’re going to rely on the transmission to slow us down,’ ” he told Postmedia Tuesday.,He believes the vehicle was going too fast as the driver was pressing on the brakes when the front wheels started to slide.,“So we started going down, maybe two seconds to five seconds after that, I hear the front wheels slide off of the glacier, and then the last thing I saw was my body flying to the roof. So I held out my hands, and then I woke up, laying next to my girlfriend,” Ernest said.,“I kind of want to believe she is the one who woke me up … because her hand was on my leg, kind of cuddling me.”,A 28-year-old woman from Edmonton and a 58-year-old man from India also died in the crash. Their names have not been released.,Ernest believes seatbelts could have saved their lives.,Pursuit did not respond to a request for comment by press deadline, but in a statement to The Canadian Press said vehicles don’t have seatbelts because they aren’t approved to run on highways and don’t go faster than 40 km/h.,“Once the investigation is complete, we will take every recommendation into careful consideration for future operations,” communications manager Tanya Otis wrote in an email.,Ernest was discharged from Edmonton’s Royal Alexandra Hospital,Tuesday with a concussion, more than 10 stitches each in his head and hand, a fractured wrist and other bruises and cuts. He said Pursuit has not reached out to him.,Ernest described his girlfriend as caring person who loved her family and the planet.,“She would always cuddle me whenever I felt sad. The most loving person ever,” he said. “I’m so sad right now.”,Durocher’s family said she was a gentle and loving person, and she wanted to join the army.,“Even though she’s tiny, she wants to reach big goals,” Rose Durocher, her aunt, told Postmedia Tuesday.,“She was very loving, caring, compassionate to others, especially in her family, and her mom … she has a lot of friends because of her special personality.”,Her parents did not want to speak to media, but her father John Ronnie Durocher Sr. wrote a poem for her obituary, according to Rose Durocher.,“I love you from the bottom of my heart, always brightens up my day with that perfect smile. Your happiness puts a song in my heart, that is why you will always be my one and only sweetheart,” reads the poem.,RCMP said they expected the vehicle to be removed from the scene by Tuesday night.,Police have said the rocky terrain and the extent of damage to the large vehicle make it difficult to remove it without compromising the crash investigation.,Cpl. Deanna Fontaine said police hired contractors, including heavy equipment operators, to help remove the vehicle, which would require “modifying the landscape” to build a temporary road.,“We are getting the assistance of qualified people, proper equipment … so we’re able to continue with our investigation in a manner that protects the integrity of the evidence involved, and the safety of all involved,” she said Tuesday.,Pursuit’s website describes the Ice Explorer vehicle as a 3.86 metres tall, 13 metres long and 3.6 metres wide. The off-road tour buses are painted red and white, and have six large monster truck-style wheels."

Alberta technology projects to receive $58.4 million in Natural Gas Challenge,"Jul 21, 2020","Using artificial intelligence and machine learning to measure and locate methane emissions, and producing compressed natural gas for vehicles are two of the 20 projects getting a combined $58.4 million from the government through Emissions Reduction Alberta.,The Alberta government announced the finalists of the Natural Gas Challenge on Tuesday. The funding, , comes from the Technology Innovation Emissions Reduction (TIER) program, paid for by a carbon tax on large emitters.,Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA) said it received 117 applications and chose, Among them are Edmonton and Capital Power, which will get $10 million to upgrade landfill gas at Clover Bar Landfill and inject it into Alberta’s natural gas system as renewable natural gas., will get $5 million to work with an oil and gas operation to build a modular farming system to grow crops, and ATCO Gas and Pipelines will get $7.9 million to produce renewable natural gas to be sold and used within the province in compressed natural gas fleet vehicles and commercial applications., will get $4 million to use artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to better measure emissions.,Environment and Parks Minister Jason Nixon said the projects are estimated to be worth $155 million along with private investment.,“This is a real testament to the type of ingenuity and skills associated with this challenge in our province,” Nixon said at an ERA webinar event.,If successful, the projects will lead to cumulative greenhouse gas reductions of almost one million tonnes of CO2 by 2030 — equivalent to the GHG emissions from 750,000 passenger vehicles driven for one year — according to the ERA.,Associate minister of natural gas and electricity Dale Nally said the funding was critical to helping offset higher capital costs, attracting investment and keeping Alberta industries competitive.,The government said it anticipates these projects will deliver approximately 760 new jobs."
"Braid: As COVID-19 soars again, Kenney says kids will be safe in schools this fall","Jul 22, 2020","By any measure, Alberta is no longer doing well with this pandemic. Infections are rising. The count jumped sharply again Monday, with 141 new cases.,Over four days since last Friday, the total is 509 new infections. Health authorities expect this to get worse before (or if) this new surge is controlled.,Altogether, Tuesday was one strange day for the UCP government to roll out plans for a ,.,First, Premier Jason Kenney said the new spike is very concerning and almost begged people to wear masks, comply with social distancing and keep gatherings small.,“I plead with Albertans not to give up on the progress that we’ve made,” he said. “The last thing we want to have to do is re-impose damaging restrictions on our economy and our freedoms.,“COVID-19 is not over. And it likely won’t be over for months to come.,“If you think you can socialize with large groups of people in closed quarters, knock it off!”,Calgary council stepped in Tuesday with a surprise bylaw to ,, effective Aug. 1.,But Kenney was giving his own clear warning that a continuing surge of cases could mean more closings in the province.,And then came one of the weirdest switches on record.,Kenney, along with Education Minister Adriana LaGrange and public health chief Dr. Deena Hinshaw, went on to argue that it’s safe to reopen schools.,The premier said studies and experience in other countries prove that children have a low rate of infection and don’t get serious cases of the disease.,“The evidence is overwhelming that schools can be operated safely with little health risk for children and teachers, and low risk of causing serious outbreaks in the communities that surround them.,“The younger the child, the lower the risk,” he said, adding that young kids don’t transmit the disease the way adults do.,Kenney cited successful school openings in Europe, especially Denmark, and also mentioned B.C.’s decision to briefly reopen schools in June.,So, that was the premier’s case. It reminded me uncomfortably of his assertion in May that homeless people have “a very high level of immune resistance, of immunity, and resilience against an influenza of this nature.”,Actually, experts say the homeless have lower infection rates because they spend so much time outdoors and often roam alone or in small groups.,In any case, we can only hope he’s right about safety in the schools, because the alternative is suffering and incalculable social disruption. The initial explosion of protest on social media showed he’s got a lot of convincing to do.,Kenney was backed in his views by both LaGrange and Hinshaw, although I thought the doctor was more reticent.,“I want to stress there is no risk-free approach to living with COVID-19,” Hinshaw said. “We still have to learn to live with it. There are no easy places in front of us.”,She agreed that kids usually have mild disease and don’t transmit as readily, but then added:,“Despite this, COVID-19 still needs to be taken seriously … we will almost certainly identify cases of COVID-19 in students and staff in the fall.” The task, she added, will be to “limit onward spread.”,The government won’t make kids wear masks. With young ones especially, they’d likely come off for use as slingshots. Teachers won’t be forced to wear masks either.,Altogether, this is optimism wrapped in hope and sealed with a prayer.,Kenney is right when he says closed schools mean delayed education and severe social challenges for both kids and families. Our whole society is geared to having children in school 10 months a year.,But this will be extremely difficult for the schools, the parents, the kids and especially teachers. They face a maze of new rules that will make school life immensely more complex and stressful.,Good luck to them all. May Kenney’s COVID-free bubble descend upon them.,Twitter: ,Facebook: "
"Skateboarding pros take sport, along with message of hope, to Indigenous youth","Jul 21, 2020","Believing it saved them from taking the wrong path, a group of avid skateboarders is touring Alberta reserves to share their sport with Indigenous youth.,“Skateboarding has given us so much. We just want to spread the message. We don’t want to see more youth struggle with mental health, suicide. We want them to be happy, active and empowered,” said Rose Archie, one of the organizers of Nations Skate Youth.,The group of five includes two former Calgary brothers — Tristan and Dustin Henry who grew up skateboarding at Millennium Park — along with Joe Buffalo from Alberta’s Maskwacis reserve, Adam George from Ontario, and Archie from the interior of B.C. Both Dustin and Buffalo are pro riders: Dustin is with the Altimers Skateboards team, which has travelled to Los Angeles for videos, and Buffalo with Colonialism Skateboards out of Regina.,Archie said the project came about after a panel discussion in February promoting social change and mental health among Indigenous youth. All of the members know each other from skateboarding in Vancouver, where they now live, and each has their own reasons for taking part, from personal experience with racism to overcoming harm from residential schools.,“Mental health is close to me because my sister had an accidental suicide. It had me looking at the suicide rates on reserves. I heard people say my sister was just a statistic,” said Archie.,“My message to youth is that their voice is important. They need to be proud of who they are,” said Archie, 38, who has been skateboarding since 1992 and has taught girls’ lessons for the past seven years. She became involved with community work after struggling for years with her identity after growing up on a reserve.,“I was kind of ashamed of being Indigenous. I just want to give others hope.”,Buffalo grew up in the residential school system and he felt skateboarding helped him survive. “It taught me perseverance, taught me how to tolerate a lot of things. It’s definitely been a helpful tool to help me navigate through life,” he told a Fort St. John TV station that reported on the group’s visit there.,To support the visit to five reserves and a wrap-up talk in Red Deer, Archie created a , which is close to doubling its goal of $10,000. The proceeds will support the trip and help purchase some gear for the kids. They have also received some donated skateboards, helmets and shoes that they will leave in some of the communities they visit.,Beyond inspiring youth to take up a sport they all say is in their blood, Archie said the five are hoping to encourage reserves to build skateparks or at least make a start by creating ramps and other obstacles.,“I was hitchhiking one and a half to two hours to skateboard and I was 14. If there had been a park on the reserve, I would have been doing it there.”,Nations Skate Youth has visited Tsuut’ina Nation and Morley this week, and moves on to Maskwacis on July 23, Enoch Cree Nation July 24, Alexis Nakota Sioux Nation July 25 and Red Deer on July 26."
Alberta Medical Association holding confidence vote on health minister as dispute over pay continues,"Jul 21, 2020","The Alberta Medical Association is asking its member physicians to vote on whether they have enough confidence in Health Minister Tyler Shandro to continue trying to negotiate a compensation agreement with him.,The association’s president, Dr. Christine Molnar, released a statement Tuesday saying it made the “unprecedented decision” because the physician community is in deep distress.,“After experiencing months of anxiety in the toxic environment that the minister’s actions have created, combined with shrinking practice revenue and the COVID-19 crisis, many physicians are wondering how they will continue,” she said.,The move to gather input will decide what the AMA does next in the ongoing impasse between doctors and the provincial government.,“This vote isn’t symbolism. It’s about action,” said Dr. Molnar.,Shandro’s press secretary, Steve Buick, said in a statement the government has a mandate to reduce wait times and make the health system more efficient.,“That is exactly what we are doing. An online survey of a comparatively small number of the highest earners does not change that,” said Buick.,If members express confidence in the Minister, then the AMA will continue to try to work with him, Molnar said.,But if its members decide they do not have confidence in Shandro, the AMA will ask Premier Jason Kenney to intervene to restart contract talks or appoint an independent third-party arbitrator. In its statement, the AMA said it would not demand that Shandro be fired.,“And if the premier is unable or unwilling to address the issue, then there really is only one higher authority to whom we can appeal — the public, our patients — and that’s where we will need to concentrate our efforts,” said Molnar. The AMA’s vote will be , until July 28.,NDP health critic David Shepherd said Tuesday the government was being dismissive and insulting, and noted many staff in the premier’s office earn higher salaries than some family doctors.,“This government would be well served to sit down and actually listen to the voices of front line doctors,” said Shepherd.,The AMA’s move was a very clear public indictment of Shandro’s handling of the health file, Shepherd said, standing by his call that the minister needs to be removed if he is not able to negotiate a deal.,“They need to find somebody who is able to do that work without the level of destruction that we’ve seen him bring,” Shepherd said.,In February, Shandro ripped up , with doctors after negotiations broke down. The AMA said it presented cost-saving offers to the government in February, March, and on July 1, while Shandro has repeatedly said he is open to credible proposals.,An AMA survey recently found that , were considering leaving Alberta.

"Mixed bag for farmers as 2020 growing season marked by hail, rain","Jul 21, 2020","Some Alberta farmers are looking forward to one of the best harvests they’ve had in years while other farmers are anticipating one of the worst, thanks to the mixed bag of weather conditions the province has experienced thus far in 2020.,According to the Alberta government’s most recent ,, dated July 14, crops across the province are doing better than the five-year average in most regions. Provincially, crop growing conditions are rated 78 per cent good to excellent, compared to the five-year average of 64 per cent.,That’s good news for farmers like Dave Bishop, who grows barley, wheat, canola and peas in the southern part of the province, near the village of Barons, east of Claresholm. After , or near-drought conditions in the region, Bishop said his crops are looking good.,“It’s been dry for the last few years, but this year we’ve had more than our share of rain so the crops are generally looking terrific,” Bishop said. “We’re looking forward to this year’s harvest, because we’re actually going to have some crop to harvest.”,But not all producers are so lucky. Outside of southern Alberta, regions that weren’t suffering for a lack of moisture prior to this summer are now dealing with way too much due to persistent rain. According to the provincial crop report, soil moisture reserves are near normal or higher for more than 95 per cent of the province, with some wet areas in the central, northeast, northwest and Peace regions experiencing soil moisture levels at or near 50-year highs.,In some areas, fields are soaked with standing water while pastures are flooding and dying off. In the northwest part of the province, for example, crop conditions are rated 31 per cent below the five-year average.,“Our crops here are not very good,” said John Guelly, who farms in the Westlock area in central Alberta. “The ground is so saturated that the roots just can’t get any oxygen. A lot of the crop has just been choked right off. What is there is very sparse and spindly … it’s going to make harvest more of a recovery effort than a harvest.”,Guelly added his farm has had about 30 centimetres of rain since the beginning of May, which is not an excessive amount, but the ground was already waterlogged from last year’s rainy summer and fall and then this winter’s heavy snowpack. He said last year, harvest in his area was so wet that combines were leaving muddy ruts in the fields.,“This will be our fifth bad year, for one reason or another. We had the smoke from the forest fires a couple years ago which delayed crop maturity, and then last year’s late harvest,” he said. “It’s just been one thing after another. We keep hoping to get back to a normal year.”,At her family’s farm near Acme, Tara Sawyer is also wishing for a “normal” year. The fields on the Sawyer farm were ravaged by the same , that wreaked havoc upon homes and businesses in northeast Calgary.,“It got 100 per cent of our crops. They’re starting to recover now, but we certainly have a lot of damage,” she said. “The canola took the worst of it; it doesn’t bounce back as well.”,Sawyer said while most of the crop will be salvageable, they will need some hot, sunny weather to help them catch up to where they would have been without the storm damage. And regardless of how the rest of the season goes, Sawyer’s crop has lost significant value.,“You know you don’t have the control, you know it’s Mother Nature, but that still doesn’t make it feel any better,” Sawyer said. “It’s disheartening for a day or two, but then you have to start thinking about what you’re going to do to rally back.”,Twitter: "
Parks Canada officials confirm euthanized wolf was behind Egypt Lake Campground incident,"Jul 21, 2020","The young, male wolf that was killed earlier this month due to its concerning behaviour near Sunshine Village is confirmed to be the same wolf responsible for entering multiple tents at the Egypt Lake Campground, according to Parks Canada officials.,At the beginning of July, the wolf had demonstrated food-conditioned behaviour near Sunshine Village and staff reported seeing it near Sunshine Road. Parks Canada staff captured the wolf while it was entering a storage building and an examination found the wolf had an “excessive level of habituation and human food conditioning,” which made it too dangerous to be released.,The wolf was euthanized and DNA samples were taken to compare its DNA to samples taken from Egypt Lake Campground, only 13 kilometres from the Sunshine sightings, where a wolf had entered multiple tents, leaving its DNA behind.,Parks Canada said in a statement Tuesday that the DNA results confirm the euthanized wolf was also responsible for the Egypt Lake Campground incident. As a result, the , in the Egypt Lake area have been lifted.,In an ,, Bill Hunt, resource conservation manager with Parks Canada, said the male wolf and a second wolf that was also euthanized this month were not known to park officials who closely monitor the Bow Valley pack. He said it’s a mystery where the two wolves originated from.,“This is highly unusual,” said Hunt. “Around the town of Banff, the last time we’ve had to do this was in 2016. So it’s odd these two incidents occurred within the same week. We can’t always speculate what that’s about.”,Parks Canada is reminding visitors and residents to do their part to protect the wolves in Banff National Park by always securing food and garbage, never feeding wildlife and reporting all wolf sightings to Banff Dispatch at 403-762-1470.,Twitter: "

Get em!” (Buddy is an Edmonton police dog.),Another image features the cover of the children’s book ,, with the titular character saying “Beny will never find me in here!!” (Beny is also a police dog.),Edmonton police confirmed the images are being investigated.,Police did not say who created or posted the images.,Jibril Ibrahim, president of the Somali Canadian Cultural Society of Edmonton and co-chair of the EPS ,, called the images “disturbing.”,“I was hoping that we learned a lesson from what is happening at this moment,” he said. “But … if they are putting those kinds of things (on) their own lockers, that creates kind of a feeling within the community that EPS is out there to get them.”,“It shows a lack of respect,” he added.,Ibrahim echoed calls — supported by , — to create an independent, third-party organization like the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) to investigate Police Act misconduct.,Richard Mirasty, an Edmonton defence lawyer who is Cree, has had several clients injured by police dogs.,“In a police station, where … a good percentage of the people that they interact with on a daily basis are BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of colour), to have this in the locker room of a police officer is unacceptable and should not be tolerated.”,“Some might say this is sort of benign, and not harmful, and it’s just boys being boys, but it’s just really unacceptable behaviour in today’s climate,” he added. “And really it was never acceptable.”,Micki Ruth, chair of the Edmonton Police Commission, said the commission was earlier made aware of the images and alerted McFee, who by then knew about the posters.,“In order to have an effective and efficient police service, it’s got to be one that does not subject its own members, let alone anybody else, to any kind of harassment or discrimination,” she said. “The two just don’t go together.”,She said so far, the commission is satisfied with the service’s response. “We’ll continue to follow up,” she added.,The canine unit is based out of a kennel facility located near the former municipal airport. It includes 12 dog teams, who specialize in tracking suspects.,According to the police commission’s ,, which provides statistics on use of force incidents, police dogs were present at 511 incidents last year and came into “contact” with a person on 89 occasions.,The PSB investigates misconduct allegations against officers. The police chief has the ultimate say over whether to charge an officer under the provincial Police Act and send a case to a formal hearing.,An officer can be charged with a variety of Police Act offences — including discreditable conduct, insubordination and deceit — and can face reprimands, pay cuts, reductions in rank and even dismissal if convicted."
"Man who survived Icefield tour crash says driver joked about lack of seatbelts, noted vehicle speed","Jul 22, 2020","Moments before the Ice Explorer’s fatal roll at Columbia Icefield, the driver joked about how there weren’t any seatbelts and pointed to the vehicle’s speed as she pressed on the brakes, says a passenger.,Devon Ray Ernest was one of 27 people inside a vehicle operated by Pursuit that crashed during a tour of the Athabasca Glacier Saturday afternoon, killing three and critically injuring 14. A total of 24 people were injured.,His girlfriend of two years, Dionne Durocher, 24, from North Battleford died at the scene.,Ernest, Durocher and his cousin took the tour on the last day of their trip, which they planned as a belated birthday gift to him. The glacier tour was their last stop.,“Right when we got on the glacier tour bus, the driver said, ‘Fasten your seatbelts,’ and we all looked around us, trying look for seatbelts and there was nothing. And then a couple seconds later, she said, ‘We’re going to rely on the transmission to slow us down,’ ” he told Postmedia Tuesday.,He believes the vehicle was going too fast as the driver was pressing on the brakes when the front wheels started to slide.,“So we started going down, maybe two seconds to five seconds after that, I hear the front wheels slide off of the glacier, and then the last thing I saw was my body flying to the roof. So I held out my hands, and then I woke up, laying next to my girlfriend,” Ernest said.,“I kind of want to believe she is the one who woke me up … because her hand was on my leg, kind of cuddling me.”,A 28-year-old woman from Edmonton and a 58-year-old man from India also died in the crash. Their names have not been released.,Ernest believes seatbelts could have saved their lives.,Pursuit did not respond to a request for comment by press deadline, but in a statement to The Canadian Press said vehicles don’t have seatbelts because they aren’t approved to run on highways and don’t go faster than 40 km/h.,“Once the investigation is complete, we will take every recommendation into careful consideration for future operations,” communications manager Tanya Otis wrote in an email.,Ernest was discharged from Edmonton’s Royal Alexandra Hospital,Tuesday with a concussion, more than 10 stitches each in his head and hand, a fractured wrist and other bruises and cuts. He said Pursuit has not reached out to him.,Ernest described his girlfriend as caring person who loved her family and the planet.,“She would always cuddle me whenever I felt sad. The most loving person ever,” he said. “I’m so sad right now.”,Durocher’s family said she was a gentle and loving person, and she wanted to join the army.,“Even though she’s tiny, she wants to reach big goals,” Rose Durocher, her aunt, told Postmedia Tuesday.,“She was very loving, caring, compassionate to others, especially in her family, and her mom … she has a lot of friends because of her special personality.”,Her parents did not want to speak to media, but her father John Ronnie Durocher Sr. wrote a poem for her obituary, according to Rose Durocher.,“I love you from the bottom of my heart, always brightens up my day with that perfect smile. Your happiness puts a song in my heart, that is why you will always be my one and only sweetheart,” reads the poem.,RCMP said they expected the vehicle to be removed from the scene by Tuesday night.,Police have said the rocky terrain and the extent of damage to the large vehicle make it difficult to remove it without compromising the crash investigation.,Cpl. Deanna Fontaine said police hired contractors, including heavy equipment operators, to help remove the vehicle, which would require “modifying the landscape” to build a temporary road.,“We are getting the assistance of qualified people, proper equipment … so we’re able to continue with our investigation in a manner that protects the integrity of the evidence involved, and the safety of all involved,” she said Tuesday.,Pursuit’s website describes the Ice Explorer vehicle as a 3.86 metres tall, 13 metres long and 3.6 metres wide. The off-road tour buses are painted red and white, and have six large monster truck-style wheels."
"Edmonton's CFL football team to discontinue use of 'Eskimos' name, will gather public feedback on new name","Jul 22, 2020","Edmonton’s CFL football team will no longer be known as the Eskimos, as the club has decided to discontinue the name after feedback from Inuit communities.,Board of directors chairwoman Janice Agrios made the official announcement Tuesday afternoon following weeks of increasing pressure to change the derogatory name, which was adopted by the football club more than 100 years ago in an effort to honour the toughness and resiliency of Canada’s Inuit people. Postmedia first reported on the name change ,.,The team will be known as the EE Football Team and the Edmonton Football Team while a public engagement process is conducted for a new name.,A survey on the former name launched by the club in early July in response to the public calls for change found a clear shift in views from previous community consultations over the past three years. The team also lost sponsorship support from Boston Pizza and , with the team if the name wasn’t changed.,“I think that most people will say that the whole world has changed in the last few months. The engagement and the surveys that we’ve done over the last several weeks in response to current discussions clearly demonstrated that perspectives regarding the name are changing and we made the decision to change the name as a result of this input,” Agrios said Tuesday during a news conference.,“Our most recent opinion research shows plainly that views are shifting quickly. People who defended the name only a year ago are less comfortable with it now.”,Back in February, the team decided to,, Agrios said. Results from the previous engagement released by Agrios last Wednesday showed 78 per cent of Western Arctic Inuit respondents opposed a name change while 55 per cent of Inuit in Nunavut were against it. But Canada’s national Inuit organization, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK), has vocally supported a new name.,ITK welcomed the announcement Tuesday, saying ongoing use of the team name is damaging to Inuit people and reconciliation.,“The process of recognizing and responding to these harmful effects is key to reconciliation between Inuit and Canada, and contributes to the monumental work required to dismantle systemic racism,” the organization said in a statement posted to its website. “ITK is grateful for the vocal support that has contributed to bring about this decision — from Inuit youth to corporate sponsors and Canadian citizens who saw an injustice and felt compelled to speak out. Your voices have brought us here.”,Club president and CEO Chris Presson said he is hopeful the renaming process will be complete when the team returns to home turf at Commonwealth Stadium. If a modified season takes place this summer in a bubble format, Presson said a new team name won’t be finalized by that time and isn’t clear what jerseys would be worn.,The club will pick a new name with the goal of allowing the “EE” logo and green-and-gold colour scheme to continue, Presson said.,“I can tell you that we sure love our green and gold and our double ‘E.’ It’s early days, but we hope to keep that iconic logo,” he said. “We understand the meaning of those colours and the emblem to our fans and to our community and we certainly don’t want to upset that.”,Although the quest for a new name is in its early stages, Presson said the club plans to include Inuit communities in the decision and also involve fans.,Aaron Paquette, Edmonton’s only Indigenous city councillor, said the team’s decision is a big step forward and he is hopeful the new name will honour the area’s Inuit community. The city’s naming committee is in the process of determining Indigenous names for the 12 new wards in the next election.,“Nothing really says that everyone is welcome more than deciding to end a century of a problematic name and move forward in a good way with collaboration of all the affected communities,” he said. “Nothing changes about the history of the team, but more people can be welcomed into the fandom. It’s a win for everyone.”,Mayor Don Iveson took to social media minutes after the announcement to share his support for the decision. Back in November 2017, Iveson , after Métis Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman said it is time for a more inclusive name.,“"
Alberta to re-open K-to-12 schools in September with measures to limit the spread of COVID-19,"Jul 21, 2020","Alberta schools will open this September at near-normal operations with some health measures in place to help protect students and staff against COVID-19.,Education Minister Adriana LaGrange and Premier Jason Kenney made the announcement Tuesday afternoon at a COVID-19 briefing.,Kenney said he expects schools will do their best to follow guidelines developed by the government including reorganized classrooms to allow for physical distancing, strict stay-at-home policies if students or staff are sick, the use of hand sanitizer, frequent cleaning and staggered start times.,Students, staff and visitors will be expected to use a , daily to determine whether they can enter the school.,The government has also developed a re-entry tool kit to prepare parents and students for what to expect in the new school year. The kit includes videos for students, a guide for parents, frequently asked questions, school posters, a self-screening questionnaire in multiple languages and links to health guidelines.,LaGrange said that if a student or staff member test positive, the case will be investigated by health officials and parents will be informed if a case is confirmed in their school.,If there is an outbreak in a community or school the government could decide to transfer students to part-time classes or at home learning, she said.,If necessary, protocols will be adjusted based on the advice from the province’s chief medical officer of health.,Alberta classrooms have been closed since March 15 to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Districts were told to prepare for three potential scenarios for the upcoming school year: a return to near-normal, a partial reopening of schools, and a continuation of remote learning from home.,The government chose the option that allows the most potential physical contact despite a recent uptick in the number of COVID-19 cases in the province. Alberta reported 141 new cases on Monday. Over the weekend, there were 165 new cases on Friday, 106 on Saturday and 97 on Sunday.,The majority of active cases across Alberta are happening among those between the ages of 20 and 39.,Kenney said children and young people are at low risk of infection and severe health consequences. Only 14 per cent of Alberta cases are kids under 19, he said."
"COVID-19: Hinshaw expresses concern over rise in cases as 141 reported, two more deaths","Jul 22, 2020","Alberta’s chief medical officer of health again expressed concern over the rising number of COVID-19 cases Tuesday as the province reported 141 new cases and two deaths.,Over the past few days, the number of new cases has been in the triple digits, with Sunday being the exception. The vast majority are among those between the ages of 20 and 39. To date, the total number of active cases in the province is 1,193.,The latest deaths happened in the Calgary and Edmonton Zones, bringing the provincial total to 172.,During the Tuesday update, Dr. Deena Hinshaw said the province is watching the situation closely.,“I am concerned by the continued rise in active cases,” she said. “We know that it is possible that new cases could spike in a very rapid way once it reaches that tipping point where you have enough new cases with enough contacts. I don’t think we’ve crossed that tipping point.”,Premier Jason Kenney, who was also at the update to announce ,, pleaded with Albertans to continue to follow health guidelines, including physically distancing.,“The last thing we want to do is reimpose damaging restrictions on our economy and our freedoms,” he said. “COVID-19 is not over and it likely won’t be over for months to come. Let me be blunt. If you think you can socialize with large groups of people in close quarters, knock it off. If you’re young and healthy, remember you could still carry and transmit the virus that ends up killing someone who is old and vulnerable.”,One of the two deaths reported Tuesday is linked to the outbreak at Edmonton’s Good Samaritan Southgate Care Centre.,Alberta Health said in an email a woman in her 70s died in connection to the outbreak at the long-term care home, which was declared on June 13. This brings the total death count to four. All were residents at the home. To date, there are 43 active cases among residents and 11 among staff. Five people have recovered so far.,The other death was a woman in her 80s in the Calgary Zone.,On a positive note, Hinshaw said the province has seen an improvement in people following public health guidelines at beaches after issues of overcrowding surfaced two weeks ago.,Last week that changed thanks to the efforts in communities like Sylvan Lake and Chestermere, Hinshaw said.,“We had very few reports of issues at beaches across the province last week,” she said. “The future is up to us and we can change it. Just like how we worked together to address the specific issue of beach overcrowding, we can address other issues, limit the spread of the virus, lower our daily case numbers.”,Ninety-three people in Alberta are in hospital because of COVID-19, 16 of which are in intensive care. To date, 8,363 people have recovered. The province has also completed nearly 600,000 tests.,There have been 7,728 total cases in Alberta.,In Canada, there have been 111,697 confirmed cases and 8,857 deaths, according to the ,.

Alberta Medical Association holding confidence vote on health minister as dispute over pay continues,"Jul 21, 2020","The Alberta Medical Association is asking its member physicians to vote on whether they have enough confidence in Health Minister Tyler Shandro to continue trying to negotiate a compensation agreement with him.,The association’s president, Dr. Christine Molnar, released a statement Tuesday saying it made the “unprecedented decision” because the physician community is in deep distress.,“After experiencing months of anxiety in the toxic environment that the minister’s actions have created, combined with shrinking practice revenue and the COVID-19 crisis, many physicians are wondering how they will continue,” she said.,The move to gather input will decide what the AMA does next in the ongoing impasse between doctors and the provincial government.,“This vote isn’t symbolism. It’s about action,” said Dr. Molnar.,Shandro’s press secretary, Steve Buick, said in a statement the government has a mandate to reduce wait times and make the health system more efficient.,“That is exactly what we are doing. An online survey of a comparatively small number of the highest earners does not change that,” said Buick.,If members express confidence in the Minister, then the AMA will continue to try to work with him, Molnar said.,But if its members decide they do not have confidence in Shandro, the AMA will ask Premier Jason Kenney to intervene to restart contract talks or appoint an independent third-party arbitrator. In its statement, the AMA said it would not demand that Shandro be fired.,“And if the premier is unable or unwilling to address the issue, then there really is only one higher authority to whom we can appeal — the public, our patients — and that’s where we will need to concentrate our efforts,” said Molnar. The AMA’s vote will be , until July 28.,NDP health critic David Shepherd said Tuesday the government was being dismissive and insulting, and noted many staff in the premier’s office earn higher salaries than some family doctors.,“This government would be well served to sit down and actually listen to the voices of front line doctors,” said Shepherd.,The AMA’s move was a very clear public indictment of Shandro’s handling of the health file, Shepherd said, standing by his call that the minister needs to be removed if he is not able to negotiate a deal.,“They need to find somebody who is able to do that work without the level of destruction that we’ve seen him bring,” Shepherd said.,In February, Shandro ripped up , with doctors after negotiations broke down. The AMA said it presented cost-saving offers to the government in February, March, and on July 1, while Shandro has repeatedly said he is open to credible proposals.,An AMA survey recently found that , were considering leaving Alberta.

Alberta technology projects to receive $58.4 million in Natural Gas Challenge,"Jul 21, 2020","Using artificial intelligence and machine learning to measure and locate methane emissions, and producing compressed natural gas for vehicles are two of the 20 projects getting a combined $58.4 million from the government through Emissions Reduction Alberta.,The Alberta government announced the finalists of the Natural Gas Challenge on Tuesday. The funding, , comes from the Technology Innovation Emissions Reduction (TIER) program, paid for by a carbon tax on large emitters.,Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA) said it received 117 applications and chose, Among them are Edmonton and Capital Power, which will get $10 million to upgrade landfill gas at Clover Bar Landfill and inject it into Alberta’s natural gas system as renewable natural gas., will get $5 million to work with an oil and gas operation to build a modular farming system to grow crops, and ATCO Gas and Pipelines will get $7.9 million to produce renewable natural gas to be sold and used within the province in compressed natural gas fleet vehicles and commercial applications., will get $4 million to use artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to better measure emissions.,Environment and Parks Minister Jason Nixon said the projects are estimated to be worth $155 million along with private investment.,“This is a real testament to the type of ingenuity and skills associated with this challenge in our province,” Nixon said at an ERA webinar event.,If successful, the projects will lead to cumulative greenhouse gas reductions of almost one million tonnes of CO2 by 2030 — equivalent to the GHG emissions from 750,000 passenger vehicles driven for one year — according to the ERA.,Associate minister of natural gas and electricity Dale Nally said the funding was critical to helping offset higher capital costs, attracting investment and keeping Alberta industries competitive.,The government said it anticipates these projects will deliver approximately 760 new jobs."
"Braid: As COVID-19 soars again, Kenney says kids will be safe in schools this fall","Jul 22, 2020","By any measure, Alberta is no longer doing well with this pandemic. Infections are rising. The count jumped sharply again Monday, with 141 new cases.,Over four days since last Friday, the total is 509 new infections. Health authorities expect this to get worse before (or if) this new surge is controlled.,Altogether, Tuesday was one strange day for the UCP government to roll out plans for a ,.,First, Premier Jason Kenney said the new spike is very concerning and almost begged people to wear masks, comply with social distancing and keep gatherings small.,“I plead with Albertans not to give up on the progress that we’ve made,” he said. “The last thing we want to have to do is re-impose damaging restrictions on our economy and our freedoms.,“COVID-19 is not over. And it likely won’t be over for months to come.,“If you think you can socialize with large groups of people in closed quarters, knock it off!”,Calgary council stepped in Tuesday with a surprise bylaw to ,, effective Aug. 1.,But Kenney was giving his own clear warning that a continuing surge of cases could mean more closings in the province.,And then came one of the weirdest switches on record.,Kenney, along with Education Minister Adriana LaGrange and public health chief Dr. Deena Hinshaw, went on to argue that it’s safe to reopen schools.,The premier said studies and experience in other countries prove that children have a low rate of infection and don’t get serious cases of the disease.,“The evidence is overwhelming that schools can be operated safely with little health risk for children and teachers, and low risk of causing serious outbreaks in the communities that surround them.,“The younger the child, the lower the risk,” he said, adding that young kids don’t transmit the disease the way adults do.,Kenney cited successful school openings in Europe, especially Denmark, and also mentioned B.C.’s decision to briefly reopen schools in June.,So, that was the premier’s case. It reminded me uncomfortably of his assertion in May that homeless people have “a very high level of immune resistance, of immunity, and resilience against an influenza of this nature.”,Actually, experts say the homeless have lower infection rates because they spend so much time outdoors and often roam alone or in small groups.,In any case, we can only hope he’s right about safety in the schools, because the alternative is suffering and incalculable social disruption. The initial explosion of protest on social media showed he’s got a lot of convincing to do.,Kenney was backed in his views by both LaGrange and Hinshaw, although I thought the doctor was more reticent.,“I want to stress there is no risk-free approach to living with COVID-19,” Hinshaw said. “We still have to learn to live with it. There are no easy places in front of us.”,She agreed that kids usually have mild disease and don’t transmit as readily, but then added:,“Despite this, COVID-19 still needs to be taken seriously … we will almost certainly identify cases of COVID-19 in students and staff in the fall.” The task, she added, will be to “limit onward spread.”,The government won’t make kids wear masks. With young ones especially, they’d likely come off for use as slingshots. Teachers won’t be forced to wear masks either.,Altogether, this is optimism wrapped in hope and sealed with a prayer.,Kenney is right when he says closed schools mean delayed education and severe social challenges for both kids and families. Our whole society is geared to having children in school 10 months a year.,But this will be extremely difficult for the schools, the parents, the kids and especially teachers. They face a maze of new rules that will make school life immensely more complex and stressful.,Good luck to them all. May Kenney’s COVID-free bubble descend upon them.,Twitter: ,Facebook: "
Parks Canada officials confirm euthanized wolf was behind Egypt Lake Campground incident,"Jul 21, 2020","The young, male wolf that was killed earlier this month due to its concerning behaviour near Sunshine Village is confirmed to be the same wolf responsible for entering multiple tents at the Egypt Lake Campground, according to Parks Canada officials.,At the beginning of July, the wolf had demonstrated food-conditioned behaviour near Sunshine Village and staff reported seeing it near Sunshine Road. Parks Canada staff captured the wolf while it was entering a storage building and an examination found the wolf had an “excessive level of habituation and human food conditioning,” which made it too dangerous to be released.,The wolf was euthanized and DNA samples were taken to compare its DNA to samples taken from Egypt Lake Campground, only 13 kilometres from the Sunshine sightings, where a wolf had entered multiple tents, leaving its DNA behind.,Parks Canada said in a statement Tuesday that the DNA results confirm the euthanized wolf was also responsible for the Egypt Lake Campground incident. As a result, the , in the Egypt Lake area have been lifted.,In an ,, Bill Hunt, resource conservation manager with Parks Canada, said the male wolf and a second wolf that was also euthanized this month were not known to park officials who closely monitor the Bow Valley pack. He said it’s a mystery where the two wolves originated from.,“This is highly unusual,” said Hunt. “Around the town of Banff, the last time we’ve had to do this was in 2016. So it’s odd these two incidents occurred within the same week. We can’t always speculate what that’s about.”,Parks Canada is reminding visitors and residents to do their part to protect the wolves in Banff National Park by always securing food and garbage, never feeding wildlife and reporting all wolf sightings to Banff Dispatch at 403-762-1470.,Twitter: "
"Mixed bag for farmers as 2020 growing season marked by hail, rain","Jul 21, 2020","Some Alberta farmers are looking forward to one of the best harvests they’ve had in years while other farmers are anticipating one of the worst, thanks to the mixed bag of weather conditions the province has experienced thus far in 2020.,According to the Alberta government’s most recent ,, dated July 14, crops across the province are doing better than the five-year average in most regions. Provincially, crop growing conditions are rated 78 per cent good to excellent, compared to the five-year average of 64 per cent.,That’s good news for farmers like Dave Bishop, who grows barley, wheat, canola and peas in the southern part of the province, near the village of Barons, east of Claresholm. After , or near-drought conditions in the region, Bishop said his crops are looking good.,“It’s been dry for the last few years, but this year we’ve had more than our share of rain so the crops are generally looking terrific,” Bishop said. “We’re looking forward to this year’s harvest, because we’re actually going to have some crop to harvest.”,But not all producers are so lucky. Outside of southern Alberta, regions that weren’t suffering for a lack of moisture prior to this summer are now dealing with way too much due to persistent rain. According to the provincial crop report, soil moisture reserves are near normal or higher for more than 95 per cent of the province, with some wet areas in the central, northeast, northwest and Peace regions experiencing soil moisture levels at or near 50-year highs.,In some areas, fields are soaked with standing water while pastures are flooding and dying off. In the northwest part of the province, for example, crop conditions are rated 31 per cent below the five-year average.,“Our crops here are not very good,” said John Guelly, who farms in the Westlock area in central Alberta. “The ground is so saturated that the roots just can’t get any oxygen. A lot of the crop has just been choked right off. What is there is very sparse and spindly … it’s going to make harvest more of a recovery effort than a harvest.”,Guelly added his farm has had about 30 centimetres of rain since the beginning of May, which is not an excessive amount, but the ground was already waterlogged from last year’s rainy summer and fall and then this winter’s heavy snowpack. He said last year, harvest in his area was so wet that combines were leaving muddy ruts in the fields.,“This will be our fifth bad year, for one reason or another. We had the smoke from the forest fires a couple years ago which delayed crop maturity, and then last year’s late harvest,” he said. “It’s just been one thing after another. We keep hoping to get back to a normal year.”,At her family’s farm near Acme, Tara Sawyer is also wishing for a “normal” year. The fields on the Sawyer farm were ravaged by the same , that wreaked havoc upon homes and businesses in northeast Calgary.,“It got 100 per cent of our crops. They’re starting to recover now, but we certainly have a lot of damage,” she said. “The canola took the worst of it; it doesn’t bounce back as well.”,Sawyer said while most of the crop will be salvageable, they will need some hot, sunny weather to help them catch up to where they would have been without the storm damage. And regardless of how the rest of the season goes, Sawyer’s crop has lost significant value.,“You know you don’t have the control, you know it’s Mother Nature, but that still doesn’t make it feel any better,” Sawyer said. “It’s disheartening for a day or two, but then you have to start thinking about what you’re going to do to rally back.”,Twitter: "
"Skateboarding pros take sport, along with message of hope, to Indigenous youth","Jul 21, 2020","Believing it saved them from taking the wrong path, a group of avid skateboarders is touring Alberta reserves to share their sport with Indigenous youth.,“Skateboarding has given us so much. We just want to spread the message. We don’t want to see more youth struggle with mental health, suicide. We want them to be happy, active and empowered,” said Rose Archie, one of the organizers of Nations Skate Youth.,The group of five includes two former Calgary brothers — Tristan and Dustin Henry who grew up skateboarding at Millennium Park — along with Joe Buffalo from Alberta’s Maskwacis reserve, Adam George from Ontario, and Archie from the interior of B.C. Both Dustin and Buffalo are pro riders: Dustin is with the Altimers Skateboards team, which has travelled to Los Angeles for videos, and Buffalo with Colonialism Skateboards out of Regina.,Archie said the project came about after a panel discussion in February promoting social change and mental health among Indigenous youth. All of the members know each other from skateboarding in Vancouver, where they now live, and each has their own reasons for taking part, from personal experience with racism to overcoming harm from residential schools.,“Mental health is close to me because my sister had an accidental suicide. It had me looking at the suicide rates on reserves. I heard people say my sister was just a statistic,” said Archie.,“My message to youth is that their voice is important. They need to be proud of who they are,” said Archie, 38, who has been skateboarding since 1992 and has taught girls’ lessons for the past seven years. She became involved with community work after struggling for years with her identity after growing up on a reserve.,“I was kind of ashamed of being Indigenous. I just want to give others hope.”,Buffalo grew up in the residential school system and he felt skateboarding helped him survive. “It taught me perseverance, taught me how to tolerate a lot of things. It’s definitely been a helpful tool to help me navigate through life,” he told a Fort St. John TV station that reported on the group’s visit there.,To support the visit to five reserves and a wrap-up talk in Red Deer, Archie created a , which is close to doubling its goal of $10,000. The proceeds will support the trip and help purchase some gear for the kids. They have also received some donated skateboards, helmets and shoes that they will leave in some of the communities they visit.,Beyond inspiring youth to take up a sport they all say is in their blood, Archie said the five are hoping to encourage reserves to build skateparks or at least make a start by creating ramps and other obstacles.,“I was hitchhiking one and a half to two hours to skateboard and I was 14. If there had been a park on the reserve, I would have been doing it there.”,Nations Skate Youth has visited Tsuut’ina Nation and Morley this week, and moves on to Maskwacis on July 23, Enoch Cree Nation July 24, Alexis Nakota Sioux Nation July 25 and Red Deer on July 26."

Get em!” (Buddy is an Edmonton police dog.),Another image features the cover of the children’s book ,, with the titular character saying “Beny will never find me in here!!” (Beny is also a police dog.),Edmonton police confirmed the images are being investigated.,Police did not say who created or posted the images.,Jibril Ibrahim, president of the Somali Canadian Cultural Society of Edmonton and co-chair of the EPS ,, called the images “disturbing.”,“I was hoping that we learned a lesson from what is happening at this moment,” he said. “But … if they are putting those kinds of things (on) their own lockers, that creates kind of a feeling within the community that EPS is out there to get them.”,“It shows a lack of respect,” he added.,Ibrahim echoed calls — supported by , — to create an independent, third-party organization like the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) to investigate Police Act misconduct.,Richard Mirasty, an Edmonton defence lawyer who is Cree, has had several clients injured by police dogs.,“In a police station, where … a good percentage of the people that they interact with on a daily basis are BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of colour), to have this in the locker room of a police officer is unacceptable and should not be tolerated.”,“Some might say this is sort of benign, and not harmful, and it’s just boys being boys, but it’s just really unacceptable behaviour in today’s climate,” he added. “And really it was never acceptable.”,Micki Ruth, chair of the Edmonton Police Commission, said the commission was earlier made aware of the images and alerted McFee, who by then knew about the posters.,“In order to have an effective and efficient police service, it’s got to be one that does not subject its own members, let alone anybody else, to any kind of harassment or discrimination,” she said. “The two just don’t go together.”,She said so far, the commission is satisfied with the service’s response. “We’ll continue to follow up,” she added.,The canine unit is based out of a kennel facility located near the former municipal airport. It includes 12 dog teams, who specialize in tracking suspects.,According to the police commission’s ,, which provides statistics on use of force incidents, police dogs were present at 511 incidents last year and came into “contact” with a person on 89 occasions.,The PSB investigates misconduct allegations against officers. The police chief has the ultimate say over whether to charge an officer under the provincial Police Act and send a case to a formal hearing.,An officer can be charged with a variety of Police Act offences — including discreditable conduct, insubordination and deceit — and can face reprimands, pay cuts, reductions in rank and even dismissal if convicted."
Alberta to re-open K-to-12 schools in September with measures to limit the spread of COVID-19,"Jul 21, 2020","Alberta schools will open this September at near-normal operations with some health measures in place to help protect students and staff against COVID-19.,Education Minister Adriana LaGrange and Premier Jason Kenney made the announcement Tuesday afternoon at a COVID-19 briefing.,Kenney said he expects schools will do their best to follow guidelines developed by the government including reorganized classrooms to allow for physical distancing, strict stay-at-home policies if students or staff are sick, the use of hand sanitizer, frequent cleaning and staggered start times.,Students, staff and visitors will be expected to use a , daily to determine whether they can enter the school.,The government has also developed a re-entry tool kit to prepare parents and students for what to expect in the new school year. The kit includes videos for students, a guide for parents, frequently asked questions, school posters, a self-screening questionnaire in multiple languages and links to health guidelines.,LaGrange said that if a student or staff member test positive, the case will be investigated by health officials and parents will be informed if a case is confirmed in their school.,If there is an outbreak in a community or school the government could decide to transfer students to part-time classes or at home learning, she said.,If necessary, protocols will be adjusted based on the advice from the province’s chief medical officer of health.,Alberta classrooms have been closed since March 15 to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Districts were told to prepare for three potential scenarios for the upcoming school year: a return to near-normal, a partial reopening of schools, and a continuation of remote learning from home.,The government chose the option that allows the most potential physical contact despite a recent uptick in the number of COVID-19 cases in the province. Alberta reported 141 new cases on Monday. Over the weekend, there were 165 new cases on Friday, 106 on Saturday and 97 on Sunday.,The majority of active cases across Alberta are happening among those between the ages of 20 and 39.,Kenney said children and young people are at low risk of infection and severe health consequences. Only 14 per cent of Alberta cases are kids under 19, he said."
"Edmonton's CFL football team to discontinue use of 'Eskimos' name, will gather public feedback on new name","Jul 22, 2020","Edmonton’s CFL football team will no longer be known as the Eskimos, as the club has decided to discontinue the name after feedback from Inuit communities.,Board of directors chairwoman Janice Agrios made the official announcement Tuesday afternoon following weeks of increasing pressure to change the derogatory name, which was adopted by the football club more than 100 years ago in an effort to honour the toughness and resiliency of Canada’s Inuit people. Postmedia first reported on the name change ,.,The team will be known as the EE Football Team and the Edmonton Football Team while a public engagement process is conducted for a new name.,A survey on the former name launched by the club in early July in response to the public calls for change found a clear shift in views from previous community consultations over the past three years. The team also lost sponsorship support from Boston Pizza and , with the team if the name wasn’t changed.,“I think that most people will say that the whole world has changed in the last few months. The engagement and the surveys that we’ve done over the last several weeks in response to current discussions clearly demonstrated that perspectives regarding the name are changing and we made the decision to change the name as a result of this input,” Agrios said Tuesday during a news conference.,“Our most recent opinion research shows plainly that views are shifting quickly. People who defended the name only a year ago are less comfortable with it now.”,Back in February, the team decided to,, Agrios said. Results from the previous engagement released by Agrios last Wednesday showed 78 per cent of Western Arctic Inuit respondents opposed a name change while 55 per cent of Inuit in Nunavut were against it. But Canada’s national Inuit organization, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK), has vocally supported a new name.,ITK welcomed the announcement Tuesday, saying ongoing use of the team name is damaging to Inuit people and reconciliation.,“The process of recognizing and responding to these harmful effects is key to reconciliation between Inuit and Canada, and contributes to the monumental work required to dismantle systemic racism,” the organization said in a statement posted to its website. “ITK is grateful for the vocal support that has contributed to bring about this decision — from Inuit youth to corporate sponsors and Canadian citizens who saw an injustice and felt compelled to speak out. Your voices have brought us here.”,Club president and CEO Chris Presson said he is hopeful the renaming process will be complete when the team returns to home turf at Commonwealth Stadium. If a modified season takes place this summer in a bubble format, Presson said a new team name won’t be finalized by that time and isn’t clear what jerseys would be worn.,The club will pick a new name with the goal of allowing the “EE” logo and green-and-gold colour scheme to continue, Presson said.,“I can tell you that we sure love our green and gold and our double ‘E.’ It’s early days, but we hope to keep that iconic logo,” he said. “We understand the meaning of those colours and the emblem to our fans and to our community and we certainly don’t want to upset that.”,Although the quest for a new name is in its early stages, Presson said the club plans to include Inuit communities in the decision and also involve fans.,Aaron Paquette, Edmonton’s only Indigenous city councillor, said the team’s decision is a big step forward and he is hopeful the new name will honour the area’s Inuit community. The city’s naming committee is in the process of determining Indigenous names for the 12 new wards in the next election.,“Nothing really says that everyone is welcome more than deciding to end a century of a problematic name and move forward in a good way with collaboration of all the affected communities,” he said. “Nothing changes about the history of the team, but more people can be welcomed into the fandom. It’s a win for everyone.”,Mayor Don Iveson took to social media minutes after the announcement to share his support for the decision. Back in November 2017, Iveson , after Métis Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman said it is time for a more inclusive name.,“"
"COVID-19: Hinshaw expresses concern over rise in cases as 141 reported, two more deaths","Jul 22, 2020","Alberta’s chief medical officer of health again expressed concern over the rising number of COVID-19 cases Tuesday as the province reported 141 new cases and two deaths.,Over the past few days, the number of new cases has been in the triple digits, with Sunday being the exception. The vast majority are among those between the ages of 20 and 39. To date, the total number of active cases in the province is 1,193.,The latest deaths happened in the Calgary and Edmonton Zones, bringing the provincial total to 172.,During the Tuesday update, Dr. Deena Hinshaw said the province is watching the situation closely.,“I am concerned by the continued rise in active cases,” she said. “We know that it is possible that new cases could spike in a very rapid way once it reaches that tipping point where you have enough new cases with enough contacts. I don’t think we’ve crossed that tipping point.”,Premier Jason Kenney, who was also at the update to announce ,, pleaded with Albertans to continue to follow health guidelines, including physically distancing.,“The last thing we want to do is reimpose damaging restrictions on our economy and our freedoms,” he said. “COVID-19 is not over and it likely won’t be over for months to come. Let me be blunt. If you think you can socialize with large groups of people in close quarters, knock it off. If you’re young and healthy, remember you could still carry and transmit the virus that ends up killing someone who is old and vulnerable.”,One of the two deaths reported Tuesday is linked to the outbreak at Edmonton’s Good Samaritan Southgate Care Centre.,Alberta Health said in an email a woman in her 70s died in connection to the outbreak at the long-term care home, which was declared on June 13. This brings the total death count to four. All were residents at the home. To date, there are 43 active cases among residents and 11 among staff. Five people have recovered so far.,The other death was a woman in her 80s in the Calgary Zone.,On a positive note, Hinshaw said the province has seen an improvement in people following public health guidelines at beaches after issues of overcrowding surfaced two weeks ago.,Last week that changed thanks to the efforts in communities like Sylvan Lake and Chestermere, Hinshaw said.,“We had very few reports of issues at beaches across the province last week,” she said. “The future is up to us and we can change it. Just like how we worked together to address the specific issue of beach overcrowding, we can address other issues, limit the spread of the virus, lower our daily case numbers.”,Ninety-three people in Alberta are in hospital because of COVID-19, 16 of which are in intensive care. To date, 8,363 people have recovered. The province has also completed nearly 600,000 tests.,There have been 7,728 total cases in Alberta.,In Canada, there have been 111,697 confirmed cases and 8,857 deaths, according to the ,.

"Man who survived Icefield tour crash says driver joked about lack of seatbelts, noted vehicle speed","Jul 22, 2020","Moments before the Ice Explorer’s fatal roll at Columbia Icefield, the driver joked about how there weren’t any seatbelts and pointed to the vehicle’s speed as she pressed on the brakes, says a passenger.,Devon Ray Ernest was one of 27 people inside a vehicle operated by Pursuit that crashed during a tour of the Athabasca Glacier Saturday afternoon, killing three and critically injuring 14. A total of 24 people were injured.,His girlfriend of two years, Dionne Durocher, 24, from North Battleford died at the scene.,Ernest, Durocher and his cousin took the tour on the last day of their trip, which they planned as a belated birthday gift to him. The glacier tour was their last stop.,“Right when we got on the glacier tour bus, the driver said, ‘Fasten your seatbelts,’ and we all looked around us, trying look for seatbelts and there was nothing. And then a couple seconds later, she said, ‘We’re going to rely on the transmission to slow us down,’ ” he told Postmedia Tuesday.,He believes the vehicle was going too fast as the driver was pressing on the brakes when the front wheels started to slide.,“So we started going down, maybe two seconds to five seconds after that, I hear the front wheels slide off of the glacier, and then the last thing I saw was my body flying to the roof. So I held out my hands, and then I woke up, laying next to my girlfriend,” Ernest said.,“I kind of want to believe she is the one who woke me up … because her hand was on my leg, kind of cuddling me.”,A 28-year-old woman from Edmonton and a 58-year-old man from India also died in the crash. Their names have not been released.,Ernest believes seatbelts could have saved their lives.,Pursuit did not respond to a request for comment by press deadline, but in a statement to The Canadian Press said vehicles don’t have seatbelts because they aren’t approved to run on highways and don’t go faster than 40 km/h.,“Once the investigation is complete, we will take every recommendation into careful consideration for future operations,” communications manager Tanya Otis wrote in an email.,Ernest was discharged from Edmonton’s Royal Alexandra Hospital,Tuesday with a concussion, more than 10 stitches each in his head and hand, a fractured wrist and other bruises and cuts. He said Pursuit has not reached out to him.,Ernest described his girlfriend as caring person who loved her family and the planet.,“She would always cuddle me whenever I felt sad. The most loving person ever,” he said. “I’m so sad right now.”,Durocher’s family said she was a gentle and loving person, and she wanted to join the army.,“Even though she’s tiny, she wants to reach big goals,” Rose Durocher, her aunt, told Postmedia Tuesday.,“She was very loving, caring, compassionate to others, especially in her family, and her mom … she has a lot of friends because of her special personality.”,Her parents did not want to speak to media, but her father John Ronnie Durocher Sr. wrote a poem for her obituary, according to Rose Durocher.,“I love you from the bottom of my heart, always brightens up my day with that perfect smile. Your happiness puts a song in my heart, that is why you will always be my one and only sweetheart,” reads the poem.,RCMP said they expected the vehicle to be removed from the scene by Tuesday night.,Police have said the rocky terrain and the extent of damage to the large vehicle make it difficult to remove it without compromising the crash investigation.,Cpl. Deanna Fontaine said police hired contractors, including heavy equipment operators, to help remove the vehicle, which would require “modifying the landscape” to build a temporary road.,“We are getting the assistance of qualified people, proper equipment … so we’re able to continue with our investigation in a manner that protects the integrity of the evidence involved, and the safety of all involved,” she said Tuesday.,Pursuit’s website describes the Ice Explorer vehicle as a 3.86 metres tall, 13 metres long and 3.6 metres wide. The off-road tour buses are painted red and white, and have six large monster truck-style wheels."

Alberta Medical Association holding confidence vote on health minister as dispute over pay continues,"Jul 21, 2020","The Alberta Medical Association is asking its member physicians to vote on whether they have enough confidence in Health Minister Tyler Shandro to continue trying to negotiate a compensation agreement with him.,The association’s president, Dr. Christine Molnar, released a statement Tuesday saying it made the “unprecedented decision” because the physician community is in deep distress.,“After experiencing months of anxiety in the toxic environment that the minister’s actions have created, combined with shrinking practice revenue and the COVID-19 crisis, many physicians are wondering how they will continue,” she said.,The move to gather input will decide what the AMA does next in the ongoing impasse between doctors and the provincial government.,“This vote isn’t symbolism. It’s about action,” said Dr. Molnar.,Shandro’s press secretary, Steve Buick, said in a statement the government has a mandate to reduce wait times and make the health system more efficient.,“That is exactly what we are doing. An online survey of a comparatively small number of the highest earners does not change that,” said Buick.,If members express confidence in the Minister, then the AMA will continue to try to work with him, Molnar said.,But if its members decide they do not have confidence in Shandro, the AMA will ask Premier Jason Kenney to intervene to restart contract talks or appoint an independent third-party arbitrator. In its statement, the AMA said it would not demand that Shandro be fired.,“And if the premier is unable or unwilling to address the issue, then there really is only one higher authority to whom we can appeal — the public, our patients — and that’s where we will need to concentrate our efforts,” said Molnar. The AMA’s vote will be , until July 28.,NDP health critic David Shepherd said Tuesday the government was being dismissive and insulting, and noted many staff in the premier’s office earn higher salaries than some family doctors.,“This government would be well served to sit down and actually listen to the voices of front line doctors,” said Shepherd.,The AMA’s move was a very clear public indictment of Shandro’s handling of the health file, Shepherd said, standing by his call that the minister needs to be removed if he is not able to negotiate a deal.,“They need to find somebody who is able to do that work without the level of destruction that we’ve seen him bring,” Shepherd said.,In February, Shandro ripped up , with doctors after negotiations broke down. The AMA said it presented cost-saving offers to the government in February, March, and on July 1, while Shandro has repeatedly said he is open to credible proposals.,An AMA survey recently found that , were considering leaving Alberta.

"Skateboarding pros take sport, along with message of hope, to Indigenous youth","Jul 21, 2020","Believing it saved them from taking the wrong path, a group of avid skateboarders is touring Alberta reserves to share their sport with Indigenous youth.,“Skateboarding has given us so much. We just want to spread the message. We don’t want to see more youth struggle with mental health, suicide. We want them to be happy, active and empowered,” said Rose Archie, one of the organizers of Nations Skate Youth.,The group of five includes two former Calgary brothers — Tristan and Dustin Henry who grew up skateboarding at Millennium Park — along with Joe Buffalo from Alberta’s Maskwacis reserve, Adam George from Ontario, and Archie from the interior of B.C. Both Dustin and Buffalo are pro riders: Dustin is with the Altimers Skateboards team, which has travelled to Los Angeles for videos, and Buffalo with Colonialism Skateboards out of Regina.,Archie said the project came about after a panel discussion in February promoting social change and mental health among Indigenous youth. All of the members know each other from skateboarding in Vancouver, where they now live, and each has their own reasons for taking part, from personal experience with racism to overcoming harm from residential schools.,“Mental health is close to me because my sister had an accidental suicide. It had me looking at the suicide rates on reserves. I heard people say my sister was just a statistic,” said Archie.,“My message to youth is that their voice is important. They need to be proud of who they are,” said Archie, 38, who has been skateboarding since 1992 and has taught girls’ lessons for the past seven years. She became involved with community work after struggling for years with her identity after growing up on a reserve.,“I was kind of ashamed of being Indigenous. I just want to give others hope.”,Buffalo grew up in the residential school system and he felt skateboarding helped him survive. “It taught me perseverance, taught me how to tolerate a lot of things. It’s definitely been a helpful tool to help me navigate through life,” he told a Fort St. John TV station that reported on the group’s visit there.,To support the visit to five reserves and a wrap-up talk in Red Deer, Archie created a , which is close to doubling its goal of $10,000. The proceeds will support the trip and help purchase some gear for the kids. They have also received some donated skateboards, helmets and shoes that they will leave in some of the communities they visit.,Beyond inspiring youth to take up a sport they all say is in their blood, Archie said the five are hoping to encourage reserves to build skateparks or at least make a start by creating ramps and other obstacles.,“I was hitchhiking one and a half to two hours to skateboard and I was 14. If there had been a park on the reserve, I would have been doing it there.”,Nations Skate Youth has visited Tsuut’ina Nation and Morley this week, and moves on to Maskwacis on July 23, Enoch Cree Nation July 24, Alexis Nakota Sioux Nation July 25 and Red Deer on July 26."
Parks Canada officials confirm euthanized wolf was behind Egypt Lake Campground incident,"Jul 21, 2020","The young, male wolf that was killed earlier this month due to its concerning behaviour near Sunshine Village is confirmed to be the same wolf responsible for entering multiple tents at the Egypt Lake Campground, according to Parks Canada officials.,At the beginning of July, the wolf had demonstrated food-conditioned behaviour near Sunshine Village and staff reported seeing it near Sunshine Road. Parks Canada staff captured the wolf while it was entering a storage building and an examination found the wolf had an “excessive level of habituation and human food conditioning,” which made it too dangerous to be released.,The wolf was euthanized and DNA samples were taken to compare its DNA to samples taken from Egypt Lake Campground, only 13 kilometres from the Sunshine sightings, where a wolf had entered multiple tents, leaving its DNA behind.,Parks Canada said in a statement Tuesday that the DNA results confirm the euthanized wolf was also responsible for the Egypt Lake Campground incident. As a result, the , in the Egypt Lake area have been lifted.,In an ,, Bill Hunt, resource conservation manager with Parks Canada, said the male wolf and a second wolf that was also euthanized this month were not known to park officials who closely monitor the Bow Valley pack. He said it’s a mystery where the two wolves originated from.,“This is highly unusual,” said Hunt. “Around the town of Banff, the last time we’ve had to do this was in 2016. So it’s odd these two incidents occurred within the same week. We can’t always speculate what that’s about.”,Parks Canada is reminding visitors and residents to do their part to protect the wolves in Banff National Park by always securing food and garbage, never feeding wildlife and reporting all wolf sightings to Banff Dispatch at 403-762-1470.,Twitter: "
"Mixed bag for farmers as 2020 growing season marked by hail, rain","Jul 21, 2020","Some Alberta farmers are looking forward to one of the best harvests they’ve had in years while other farmers are anticipating one of the worst, thanks to the mixed bag of weather conditions the province has experienced thus far in 2020.,According to the Alberta government’s most recent ,, dated July 14, crops across the province are doing better than the five-year average in most regions. Provincially, crop growing conditions are rated 78 per cent good to excellent, compared to the five-year average of 64 per cent.,That’s good news for farmers like Dave Bishop, who grows barley, wheat, canola and peas in the southern part of the province, near the village of Barons, east of Claresholm. After , or near-drought conditions in the region, Bishop said his crops are looking good.,“It’s been dry for the last few years, but this year we’ve had more than our share of rain so the crops are generally looking terrific,” Bishop said. “We’re looking forward to this year’s harvest, because we’re actually going to have some crop to harvest.”,But not all producers are so lucky. Outside of southern Alberta, regions that weren’t suffering for a lack of moisture prior to this summer are now dealing with way too much due to persistent rain. According to the provincial crop report, soil moisture reserves are near normal or higher for more than 95 per cent of the province, with some wet areas in the central, northeast, northwest and Peace regions experiencing soil moisture levels at or near 50-year highs.,In some areas, fields are soaked with standing water while pastures are flooding and dying off. In the northwest part of the province, for example, crop conditions are rated 31 per cent below the five-year average.,“Our crops here are not very good,” said John Guelly, who farms in the Westlock area in central Alberta. “The ground is so saturated that the roots just can’t get any oxygen. A lot of the crop has just been choked right off. What is there is very sparse and spindly … it’s going to make harvest more of a recovery effort than a harvest.”,Guelly added his farm has had about 30 centimetres of rain since the beginning of May, which is not an excessive amount, but the ground was already waterlogged from last year’s rainy summer and fall and then this winter’s heavy snowpack. He said last year, harvest in his area was so wet that combines were leaving muddy ruts in the fields.,“This will be our fifth bad year, for one reason or another. We had the smoke from the forest fires a couple years ago which delayed crop maturity, and then last year’s late harvest,” he said. “It’s just been one thing after another. We keep hoping to get back to a normal year.”,At her family’s farm near Acme, Tara Sawyer is also wishing for a “normal” year. The fields on the Sawyer farm were ravaged by the same , that wreaked havoc upon homes and businesses in northeast Calgary.,“It got 100 per cent of our crops. They’re starting to recover now, but we certainly have a lot of damage,” she said. “The canola took the worst of it; it doesn’t bounce back as well.”,Sawyer said while most of the crop will be salvageable, they will need some hot, sunny weather to help them catch up to where they would have been without the storm damage. And regardless of how the rest of the season goes, Sawyer’s crop has lost significant value.,“You know you don’t have the control, you know it’s Mother Nature, but that still doesn’t make it feel any better,” Sawyer said. “It’s disheartening for a day or two, but then you have to start thinking about what you’re going to do to rally back.”,Twitter: "
Alberta technology projects to receive $58.4 million in Natural Gas Challenge,"Jul 21, 2020","Using artificial intelligence and machine learning to measure and locate methane emissions, and producing compressed natural gas for vehicles are two of the 20 projects getting a combined $58.4 million from the government through Emissions Reduction Alberta.,The Alberta government announced the finalists of the Natural Gas Challenge on Tuesday. The funding, , comes from the Technology Innovation Emissions Reduction (TIER) program, paid for by a carbon tax on large emitters.,Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA) said it received 117 applications and chose, Among them are Edmonton and Capital Power, which will get $10 million to upgrade landfill gas at Clover Bar Landfill and inject it into Alberta’s natural gas system as renewable natural gas., will get $5 million to work with an oil and gas operation to build a modular farming system to grow crops, and ATCO Gas and Pipelines will get $7.9 million to produce renewable natural gas to be sold and used within the province in compressed natural gas fleet vehicles and commercial applications., will get $4 million to use artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to better measure emissions.,Environment and Parks Minister Jason Nixon said the projects are estimated to be worth $155 million along with private investment.,“This is a real testament to the type of ingenuity and skills associated with this challenge in our province,” Nixon said at an ERA webinar event.,If successful, the projects will lead to cumulative greenhouse gas reductions of almost one million tonnes of CO2 by 2030 — equivalent to the GHG emissions from 750,000 passenger vehicles driven for one year — according to the ERA.,Associate minister of natural gas and electricity Dale Nally said the funding was critical to helping offset higher capital costs, attracting investment and keeping Alberta industries competitive.,The government said it anticipates these projects will deliver approximately 760 new jobs."
"Braid: As COVID-19 soars again, Kenney says kids will be safe in schools this fall","Jul 22, 2020","By any measure, Alberta is no longer doing well with this pandemic. Infections are rising. The count jumped sharply again Monday, with 141 new cases.,Over four days since last Friday, the total is 509 new infections. Health authorities expect this to get worse before (or if) this new surge is controlled.,Altogether, Tuesday was one strange day for the UCP government to roll out plans for a ,.,First, Premier Jason Kenney said the new spike is very concerning and almost begged people to wear masks, comply with social distancing and keep gatherings small.,“I plead with Albertans not to give up on the progress that we’ve made,” he said. “The last thing we want to have to do is re-impose damaging restrictions on our economy and our freedoms.,“COVID-19 is not over. And it likely won’t be over for months to come.,“If you think you can socialize with large groups of people in closed quarters, knock it off!”,Calgary council stepped in Tuesday with a surprise bylaw to ,, effective Aug. 1.,But Kenney was giving his own clear warning that a continuing surge of cases could mean more closings in the province.,And then came one of the weirdest switches on record.,Kenney, along with Education Minister Adriana LaGrange and public health chief Dr. Deena Hinshaw, went on to argue that it’s safe to reopen schools.,The premier said studies and experience in other countries prove that children have a low rate of infection and don’t get serious cases of the disease.,“The evidence is overwhelming that schools can be operated safely with little health risk for children and teachers, and low risk of causing serious outbreaks in the communities that surround them.,“The younger the child, the lower the risk,” he said, adding that young kids don’t transmit the disease the way adults do.,Kenney cited successful school openings in Europe, especially Denmark, and also mentioned B.C.’s decision to briefly reopen schools in June.,So, that was the premier’s case. It reminded me uncomfortably of his assertion in May that homeless people have “a very high level of immune resistance, of immunity, and resilience against an influenza of this nature.”,Actually, experts say the homeless have lower infection rates because they spend so much time outdoors and often roam alone or in small groups.,In any case, we can only hope he’s right about safety in the schools, because the alternative is suffering and incalculable social disruption. The initial explosion of protest on social media showed he’s got a lot of convincing to do.,Kenney was backed in his views by both LaGrange and Hinshaw, although I thought the doctor was more reticent.,“I want to stress there is no risk-free approach to living with COVID-19,” Hinshaw said. “We still have to learn to live with it. There are no easy places in front of us.”,She agreed that kids usually have mild disease and don’t transmit as readily, but then added:,“Despite this, COVID-19 still needs to be taken seriously … we will almost certainly identify cases of COVID-19 in students and staff in the fall.” The task, she added, will be to “limit onward spread.”,The government won’t make kids wear masks. With young ones especially, they’d likely come off for use as slingshots. Teachers won’t be forced to wear masks either.,Altogether, this is optimism wrapped in hope and sealed with a prayer.,Kenney is right when he says closed schools mean delayed education and severe social challenges for both kids and families. Our whole society is geared to having children in school 10 months a year.,But this will be extremely difficult for the schools, the parents, the kids and especially teachers. They face a maze of new rules that will make school life immensely more complex and stressful.,Good luck to them all. May Kenney’s COVID-free bubble descend upon them.,Twitter: ,Facebook: "

But Canada’s national Inuit organization, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK), has vocally supported a new name.,ITK welcomed the announcement Tuesday, saying ongoing use of the team name is damaging to Inuit people and reconciliation.,“The process of recognizing and responding to these harmful effects is key to reconciliation between Inuit and Canada, and contributes to the monumental work required to dismantle systemic racism,” the organization said in a statement posted to its website. “ITK is grateful for the vocal support that has contributed to bring about this decision — from Inuit youth to corporate sponsors and Canadian citizens who saw an injustice and felt compelled to speak out. Your voices have brought us here.”,Club president and CEO Chris Presson said he is hopeful the renaming process will be complete when the team returns to home turf at Commonwealth Stadium. If a modified season takes place this summer in a bubble format, Presson said a new team name won’t be finalized by that time and isn’t clear what jerseys would be worn.,The club will pick a new name with the goal of allowing the “EE” logo and green-and-gold colour scheme to continue, Presson said.,“I can tell you that we sure love our green and gold and our double ‘E.’ It’s early days, but we hope to keep that iconic logo,” he said. “We understand the meaning of those colours and the emblem to our fans and to our community and we certainly don’t want to upset that.”,Although the quest for a new name is in its early stages, Presson said the club plans to include Inuit communities in the decision and also involve fans.,Aaron Paquette, Edmonton’s only Indigenous city councillor, said the team’s decision is a big step forward and he is hopeful the new name will honour the area’s Inuit community. The city’s naming committee is in the process of determining Indigenous names for the 12 new wards in the next election.,“Nothing really says that everyone is welcome more than deciding to end a century of a problematic name and move forward in a good way with collaboration of all the affected communities,” he said. “Nothing changes about the history of the team, but more people can be welcomed into the fandom. It’s a win for everyone.”,Mayor Don Iveson took to social media minutes after the announcement to share his support for the decision. Back in November 2017, Iveson , after Métis Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman said it is time for a more inclusive name.,“"
Alberta to re-open K-to-12 schools in September with measures to limit the spread of COVID-19,"Jul 21, 2020","Alberta schools will open this September at near-normal operations with some health measures in place to help protect students and staff against COVID-19.,Education Minister Adriana LaGrange and Premier Jason Kenney made the announcement Tuesday afternoon at a COVID-19 briefing.,Kenney said he expects schools will do their best to follow guidelines developed by the government including reorganized classrooms to allow for physical distancing, strict stay-at-home policies if students or staff are sick, the use of hand sanitizer, frequent cleaning and staggered start times.,Students, staff and visitors will be expected to use a , daily to determine whether they can enter the school.,The government has also developed a re-entry tool kit to prepare parents and students for what to expect in the new school year. The kit includes videos for students, a guide for parents, frequently asked questions, school posters, a self-screening questionnaire in multiple languages and links to health guidelines.,LaGrange said that if a student or staff member test positive, the case will be investigated by health officials and parents will be informed if a case is confirmed in their school.,If there is an outbreak in a community or school the government could decide to transfer students to part-time classes or at home learning, she said.,If necessary, protocols will be adjusted based on the advice from the province’s chief medical officer of health.,Alberta classrooms have been closed since March 15 to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Districts were told to prepare for three potential scenarios for the upcoming school year: a return to near-normal, a partial reopening of schools, and a continuation of remote learning from home.,The government chose the option that allows the most potential physical contact despite a recent uptick in the number of COVID-19 cases in the province. Alberta reported 141 new cases on Monday. Over the weekend, there were 165 new cases on Friday, 106 on Saturday and 97 on Sunday.,The majority of active cases across Alberta are happening among those between the ages of 20 and 39.,Kenney said children and young people are at low risk of infection and severe health consequences. Only 14 per cent of Alberta cases are kids under 19, he said."
"Man who survived Icefield tour crash says driver joked about lack of seatbelts, noted vehicle speed","Jul 22, 2020","Moments before the Ice Explorer’s fatal roll at Columbia Icefield, the driver joked about how there weren’t any seatbelts and pointed to the vehicle’s speed as she pressed on the brakes, says a passenger.,Devon Ray Ernest was one of 27 people inside a vehicle operated by Pursuit that crashed during a tour of the Athabasca Glacier Saturday afternoon, killing three and critically injuring 14. A total of 24 people were injured.,His girlfriend of two years, Dionne Durocher, 24, from North Battleford died at the scene.,Ernest, Durocher and his cousin took the tour on the last day of their trip, which they planned as a belated birthday gift to him. The glacier tour was their last stop.,“Right when we got on the glacier tour bus, the driver said, ‘Fasten your seatbelts,’ and we all looked around us, trying look for seatbelts and there was nothing. And then a couple seconds later, she said, ‘We’re going to rely on the transmission to slow us down,’ ” he told Postmedia Tuesday.,He believes the vehicle was going too fast as the driver was pressing on the brakes when the front wheels started to slide.,“So we started going down, maybe two seconds to five seconds after that, I hear the front wheels slide off of the glacier, and then the last thing I saw was my body flying to the roof. So I held out my hands, and then I woke up, laying next to my girlfriend,” Ernest said.,“I kind of want to believe she is the one who woke me up … because her hand was on my leg, kind of cuddling me.”,A 28-year-old woman from Edmonton and a 58-year-old man from India also died in the crash. Their names have not been released.,Ernest believes seatbelts could have saved their lives.,Pursuit did not respond to a request for comment by press deadline, but in a statement to The Canadian Press said vehicles don’t have seatbelts because they aren’t approved to run on highways and don’t go faster than 40 km/h.,“Once the investigation is complete, we will take every recommendation into careful consideration for future operations,” communications manager Tanya Otis wrote in an email.,Ernest was discharged from Edmonton’s Royal Alexandra Hospital,Tuesday with a concussion, more than 10 stitches each in his head and hand, a fractured wrist and other bruises and cuts. He said Pursuit has not reached out to him.,Ernest described his girlfriend as caring person who loved her family and the planet.,“She would always cuddle me whenever I felt sad. The most loving person ever,” he said. “I’m so sad right now.”,Durocher’s family said she was a gentle and loving person, and she wanted to join the army.,“Even though she’s tiny, she wants to reach big goals,” Rose Durocher, her aunt, told Postmedia Tuesday.,“She was very loving, caring, compassionate to others, especially in her family, and her mom … she has a lot of friends because of her special personality.”,Her parents did not want to speak to media, but her father John Ronnie Durocher Sr. wrote a poem for her obituary, according to Rose Durocher.,“I love you from the bottom of my heart, always brightens up my day with that perfect smile. Your happiness puts a song in my heart, that is why you will always be my one and only sweetheart,” reads the poem.,RCMP said they expected the vehicle to be removed from the scene by Tuesday night.,Police have said the rocky terrain and the extent of damage to the large vehicle make it difficult to remove it without compromising the crash investigation.,Cpl. Deanna Fontaine said police hired contractors, including heavy equipment operators, to help remove the vehicle, which would require “modifying the landscape” to build a temporary road.,“We are getting the assistance of qualified people, proper equipment … so we’re able to continue with our investigation in a manner that protects the integrity of the evidence involved, and the safety of all involved,” she said Tuesday.,Pursuit’s website describes the Ice Explorer vehicle as a 3.86 metres tall, 13 metres long and 3.6 metres wide. The off-road tour buses are painted red and white, and have six large monster truck-style wheels."
"COVID-19: Hinshaw expresses concern over rise in cases as 141 reported, two more deaths","Jul 22, 2020","Alberta’s chief medical officer of health again expressed concern over the rising number of COVID-19 cases Tuesday as the province reported 141 new cases and two deaths.,Over the past few days, the number of new cases has been in the triple digits, with Sunday being the exception. The vast majority are among those between the ages of 20 and 39. To date, the total number of active cases in the province is 1,193.,The latest deaths happened in the Calgary and Edmonton Zones, bringing the provincial total to 172.,During the Tuesday update, Dr. Deena Hinshaw said the province is watching the situation closely.,“I am concerned by the continued rise in active cases,” she said. “We know that it is possible that new cases could spike in a very rapid way once it reaches that tipping point where you have enough new cases with enough contacts. I don’t think we’ve crossed that tipping point.”,Premier Jason Kenney, who was also at the update to announce ,, pleaded with Albertans to continue to follow health guidelines, including physically distancing.,“The last thing we want to do is reimpose damaging restrictions on our economy and our freedoms,” he said. “COVID-19 is not over and it likely won’t be over for months to come. Let me be blunt. If you think you can socialize with large groups of people in close quarters, knock it off. If you’re young and healthy, remember you could still carry and transmit the virus that ends up killing someone who is old and vulnerable.”,One of the two deaths reported Tuesday is linked to the outbreak at Edmonton’s Good Samaritan Southgate Care Centre.,Alberta Health said in an email a woman in her 70s died in connection to the outbreak at the long-term care home, which was declared on June 13. This brings the total death count to four. All were residents at the home. To date, there are 43 active cases among residents and 11 among staff. Five people have recovered so far.,The other death was a woman in her 80s in the Calgary Zone.,On a positive note, Hinshaw said the province has seen an improvement in people following public health guidelines at beaches after issues of overcrowding surfaced two weeks ago.,Last week that changed thanks to the efforts in communities like Sylvan Lake and Chestermere, Hinshaw said.,“We had very few reports of issues at beaches across the province last week,” she said. “The future is up to us and we can change it. Just like how we worked together to address the specific issue of beach overcrowding, we can address other issues, limit the spread of the virus, lower our daily case numbers.”,Ninety-three people in Alberta are in hospital because of COVID-19, 16 of which are in intensive care. To date, 8,363 people have recovered. The province has also completed nearly 600,000 tests.,There have been 7,728 total cases in Alberta.,In Canada, there have been 111,697 confirmed cases and 8,857 deaths, according to the ,.

Alberta technology projects to receive $58.4 million in Natural Gas Challenge,"Jul 21, 2020","Using artificial intelligence and machine learning to measure and locate methane emissions, and producing compressed natural gas for vehicles are two of the 20 projects getting a combined $58.4 million from the government through Emissions Reduction Alberta.,The Alberta government announced the finalists of the Natural Gas Challenge on Tuesday. The funding, , comes from the Technology Innovation Emissions Reduction (TIER) program, paid for by a carbon tax on large emitters.,Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA) said it received 117 applications and chose, Among them are Edmonton and Capital Power, which will get $10 million to upgrade landfill gas at Clover Bar Landfill and inject it into Alberta’s natural gas system as renewable natural gas., will get $5 million to work with an oil and gas operation to build a modular farming system to grow crops, and ATCO Gas and Pipelines will get $7.9 million to produce renewable natural gas to be sold and used within the province in compressed natural gas fleet vehicles and commercial applications., will get $4 million to use artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to better measure emissions.,Environment and Parks Minister Jason Nixon said the projects are estimated to be worth $155 million along with private investment.,“This is a real testament to the type of ingenuity and skills associated with this challenge in our province,” Nixon said at an ERA webinar event.,If successful, the projects will lead to cumulative greenhouse gas reductions of almost one million tonnes of CO2 by 2030 — equivalent to the GHG emissions from 750,000 passenger vehicles driven for one year — according to the ERA.,Associate minister of natural gas and electricity Dale Nally said the funding was critical to helping offset higher capital costs, attracting investment and keeping Alberta industries competitive.,The government said it anticipates these projects will deliver approximately 760 new jobs."
Alberta Medical Association holding confidence vote on health minister as dispute over pay continues,"Jul 21, 2020","The Alberta Medical Association is asking its member physicians to vote on whether they have enough confidence in Health Minister Tyler Shandro to continue trying to negotiate a compensation agreement with him.,The association’s president, Dr. Christine Molnar, released a statement Tuesday saying it made the “unprecedented decision” because the physician community is in deep distress.,“After experiencing months of anxiety in the toxic environment that the minister’s actions have created, combined with shrinking practice revenue and the COVID-19 crisis, many physicians are wondering how they will continue,” she said.,The move to gather input will decide what the AMA does next in the ongoing impasse between doctors and the provincial government.,“This vote isn’t symbolism. It’s about action,” said Dr. Molnar.,Shandro’s press secretary, Steve Buick, said in a statement the government has a mandate to reduce wait times and make the health system more efficient.,“That is exactly what we are doing. An online survey of a comparatively small number of the highest earners does not change that,” said Buick.,If members express confidence in the Minister, then the AMA will continue to try to work with him, Molnar said.,But if its members decide they do not have confidence in Shandro, the AMA will ask Premier Jason Kenney to intervene to restart contract talks or appoint an independent third-party arbitrator. In its statement, the AMA said it would not demand that Shandro be fired.,“And if the premier is unable or unwilling to address the issue, then there really is only one higher authority to whom we can appeal — the public, our patients — and that’s where we will need to concentrate our efforts,” said Molnar. The AMA’s vote will be , until July 28.,NDP health critic David Shepherd said Tuesday the government was being dismissive and insulting, and noted many staff in the premier’s office earn higher salaries than some family doctors.,“This government would be well served to sit down and actually listen to the voices of front line doctors,” said Shepherd.,The AMA’s move was a very clear public indictment of Shandro’s handling of the health file, Shepherd said, standing by his call that the minister needs to be removed if he is not able to negotiate a deal.,“They need to find somebody who is able to do that work without the level of destruction that we’ve seen him bring,” Shepherd said.,In February, Shandro ripped up , with doctors after negotiations broke down. The AMA said it presented cost-saving offers to the government in February, March, and on July 1, while Shandro has repeatedly said he is open to credible proposals.,An AMA survey recently found that , were considering leaving Alberta. On Monday, the Eye Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta , so that it could negotiate its own deal with the government, rather than through the AMA."
"Braid: As COVID-19 soars again, Kenney says kids will be safe in schools this fall","Jul 22, 2020","By any measure, Alberta is no longer doing well with this pandemic. Infections are rising. The count jumped sharply again Monday, with 141 new cases.,Over four days since last Friday, the total is 509 new infections. Health authorities expect this to get worse before (or if) this new surge is controlled.,Altogether, Tuesday was one strange day for the UCP government to roll out plans for a ,.,First, Premier Jason Kenney said the new spike is very concerning and almost begged people to wear masks, comply with social distancing and keep gatherings small.,“I plead with Albertans not to give up on the progress that we’ve made,” he said. “The last thing we want to have to do is re-impose damaging restrictions on our economy and our freedoms.,“COVID-19 is not over. And it likely won’t be over for months to come.,“If you think you can socialize with large groups of people in closed quarters, knock it off!”,Calgary council stepped in Tuesday with a surprise bylaw to ,, effective Aug. 1.,But Kenney was giving his own clear warning that a continuing surge of cases could mean more closings in the province.,And then came one of the weirdest switches on record.,Kenney, along with Education Minister Adriana LaGrange and public health chief Dr. Deena Hinshaw, went on to argue that it’s safe to reopen schools.,The premier said studies and experience in other countries prove that children have a low rate of infection and don’t get serious cases of the disease.,“The evidence is overwhelming that schools can be operated safely with little health risk for children and teachers, and low risk of causing serious outbreaks in the communities that surround them.,“The younger the child, the lower the risk,” he said, adding that young kids don’t transmit the disease the way adults do.,Kenney cited successful school openings in Europe, especially Denmark, and also mentioned B.C.’s decision to briefly reopen schools in June.,So, that was the premier’s case. It reminded me uncomfortably of his assertion in May that homeless people have “a very high level of immune resistance, of immunity, and resilience against an influenza of this nature.”,Actually, experts say the homeless have lower infection rates because they spend so much time outdoors and often roam alone or in small groups.,In any case, we can only hope he’s right about safety in the schools, because the alternative is suffering and incalculable social disruption. The initial explosion of protest on social media showed he’s got a lot of convincing to do.,Kenney was backed in his views by both LaGrange and Hinshaw, although I thought the doctor was more reticent.,“I want to stress there is no risk-free approach to living with COVID-19,” Hinshaw said. “We still have to learn to live with it. There are no easy places in front of us.”,She agreed that kids usually have mild disease and don’t transmit as readily, but then added:,“Despite this, COVID-19 still needs to be taken seriously … we will almost certainly identify cases of COVID-19 in students and staff in the fall.” The task, she added, will be to “limit onward spread.”,The government won’t make kids wear masks. With young ones especially, they’d likely come off for use as slingshots. Teachers won’t be forced to wear masks either.,Altogether, this is optimism wrapped in hope and sealed with a prayer.,Kenney is right when he says closed schools mean delayed education and severe social challenges for both kids and families. Our whole society is geared to having children in school 10 months a year.,But this will be extremely difficult for the schools, the parents, the kids and especially teachers. They face a maze of new rules that will make school life immensely more complex and stressful.,Good luck to them all. May Kenney’s COVID-free bubble descend upon them.,Twitter: ,Facebook: "
Edmonton police investigating racist images posted in canine unit locker room,"Jul 22, 2020","Investigators with the Edmonton police Professional Standards Branch are looking into a pair of images posted in the canine unit locker room containing racist caricatures of Black and Indigenous people.,Postmedia obtained photographs of the images, taken earlier this month.,One shows what appears to be a minstrel-show-style Zulu warrior in front of a cutout of a police dog, below the words “Buddy’s First Get em! Get em!” (Buddy is an Edmonton police dog.),Another image features the cover of the children’s book ,, with the titular character saying “Beny will never find me in here!!” (Beny is also a police dog.),Edmonton police confirmed the images are being investigated.,Police did not say who created or posted the images.,Jibril Ibrahim, president of the Somali Canadian Cultural Society of Edmonton and co-chair of the EPS ,, called the images “disturbing.”,“I was hoping that we learned a lesson from what is happening at this moment,” he said. “But … if they are putting those kinds of things (on) their own lockers, that creates kind of a feeling within the community that EPS is out there to get them.”,“It shows a lack of respect,” he added.,Ibrahim echoed calls — supported by , — to create an independent, third-party organization like the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) to investigate Police Act misconduct.,Richard Mirasty, an Edmonton defence lawyer who is Cree, has had several clients injured by police dogs.,“In a police station, where … a good percentage of the people that they interact with on a daily basis are BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of colour), to have this in the locker room of a police officer is unacceptable and should not be tolerated.”,“Some might say this is sort of benign, and not harmful, and it’s just boys being boys, but it’s just really unacceptable behaviour in today’s climate,” he added. “And really it was never acceptable.”,Micki Ruth, chair of the Edmonton Police Commission, said the commission was earlier made aware of the images and alerted McFee, who by then knew about the posters.,“In order to have an effective and efficient police service, it’s got to be one that does not subject its own members, let alone anybody else, to any kind of harassment or discrimination,” she said. “The two just don’t go together.”,She said so far, the commission is satisfied with the service’s response. “We’ll continue to follow up,” she added.,The canine unit is based out of a kennel facility located near the former municipal airport. It includes 12 dog teams, who specialize in tracking suspects.,According to the police commission’s ,, which provides statistics on use of force incidents, police dogs were present at 511 incidents last year and came into “contact” with a person on 89 occasions.,The PSB investigates misconduct allegations against officers. The police chief has the ultimate say over whether to charge an officer under the provincial Police Act and send a case to a formal hearing.,An officer can be charged with a variety of Police Act offences — including discreditable conduct, insubordination and deceit — and can face reprimands, pay cuts, reductions in rank and even dismissal if convicted."

"Mixed bag for farmers as 2020 growing season marked by hail, rain","Jul 21, 2020","Some Alberta farmers are looking forward to one of the best harvests they’ve had in years while other farmers are anticipating one of the worst, thanks to the mixed bag of weather conditions the province has experienced thus far in 2020.,According to the Alberta government’s most recent ,, dated July 14, crops across the province are doing better than the five-year average in most regions. Provincially, crop growing conditions are rated 78 per cent good to excellent, compared to the five-year average of 64 per cent.,That’s good news for farmers like Dave Bishop, who grows barley, wheat, canola and peas in the southern part of the province, near the village of Barons, east of Claresholm. After , or near-drought conditions in the region, Bishop said his crops are looking good.,“It’s been dry for the last few years, but this year we’ve had more than our share of rain so the crops are generally looking terrific,” Bishop said. “We’re looking forward to this year’s harvest, because we’re actually going to have some crop to harvest.”,But not all producers are so lucky. Outside of southern Alberta, regions that weren’t suffering for a lack of moisture prior to this summer are now dealing with way too much due to persistent rain. According to the provincial crop report, soil moisture reserves are near normal or higher for more than 95 per cent of the province, with some wet areas in the central, northeast, northwest and Peace regions experiencing soil moisture levels at or near 50-year highs.,In some areas, fields are soaked with standing water while pastures are flooding and dying off. In the northwest part of the province, for example, crop conditions are rated 31 per cent below the five-year average.,“Our crops here are not very good,” said John Guelly, who farms in the Westlock area in central Alberta. “The ground is so saturated that the roots just can’t get any oxygen. A lot of the crop has just been choked right off. What is there is very sparse and spindly … it’s going to make harvest more of a recovery effort than a harvest.”,Guelly added his farm has had about 30 centimetres of rain since the beginning of May, which is not an excessive amount, but the ground was already waterlogged from last year’s rainy summer and fall and then this winter’s heavy snowpack. He said last year, harvest in his area was so wet that combines were leaving muddy ruts in the fields.,“This will be our fifth bad year, for one reason or another. We had the smoke from the forest fires a couple years ago which delayed crop maturity, and then last year’s late harvest,” he said. “It’s just been one thing after another. We keep hoping to get back to a normal year.”,At her family’s farm near Acme, Tara Sawyer is also wishing for a “normal” year. The fields on the Sawyer farm were ravaged by the same , that wreaked havoc upon homes and businesses in northeast Calgary.,“It got 100 per cent of our crops. They’re starting to recover now, but we certainly have a lot of damage,” she said. “The canola took the worst of it; it doesn’t bounce back as well.”,Sawyer said while most of the crop will be salvageable, they will need some hot, sunny weather to help them catch up to where they would have been without the storm damage. And regardless of how the rest of the season goes, Sawyer’s crop has lost significant value.,“You know you don’t have the control, you know it’s Mother Nature, but that still doesn’t make it feel any better,” Sawyer said. “It’s disheartening for a day or two, but then you have to start thinking about what you’re going to do to rally back.”,Twitter: "
"Skateboarding pros take sport, along with message of hope, to Indigenous youth","Jul 21, 2020","Believing it saved them from taking the wrong path, a group of avid skateboarders is touring Alberta reserves to share their sport with Indigenous youth.,“Skateboarding has given us so much. We just want to spread the message. We don’t want to see more youth struggle with mental health, suicide. We want them to be happy, active and empowered,” said Rose Archie, one of the organizers of Nations Skate Youth.,The group of five includes two former Calgary brothers — Tristan and Dustin Henry who grew up skateboarding at Millennium Park — along with Joe Buffalo from Alberta’s Maskwacis reserve, Adam George from Ontario, and Archie from the interior of B.C. Both Dustin and Buffalo are pro riders: Dustin is with the Altimers Skateboards team, which has travelled to Los Angeles for videos, and Buffalo with Colonialism Skateboards out of Regina.,Archie said the project came about after a panel discussion in February promoting social change and mental health among Indigenous youth. All of the members know each other from skateboarding in Vancouver, where they now live, and each has their own reasons for taking part, from personal experience with racism to overcoming harm from residential schools.,“Mental health is close to me because my sister had an accidental suicide. It had me looking at the suicide rates on reserves. I heard people say my sister was just a statistic,” said Archie.,“My message to youth is that their voice is important. They need to be proud of who they are,” said Archie, 38, who has been skateboarding since 1992 and has taught girls’ lessons for the past seven years. She became involved with community work after struggling for years with her identity after growing up on a reserve.,“I was kind of ashamed of being Indigenous. I just want to give others hope.”,Buffalo grew up in the residential school system and he felt skateboarding helped him survive. “It taught me perseverance, taught me how to tolerate a lot of things. It’s definitely been a helpful tool to help me navigate through life,” he told a Fort St. John TV station that reported on the group’s visit there.,To support the visit to five reserves and a wrap-up talk in Red Deer, Archie created a , which is close to doubling its goal of $10,000. The proceeds will support the trip and help purchase some gear for the kids. They have also received some donated skateboards, helmets and shoes that they will leave in some of the communities they visit.,Beyond inspiring youth to take up a sport they all say is in their blood, Archie said the five are hoping to encourage reserves to build skateparks or at least make a start by creating ramps and other obstacles.,“I was hitchhiking one and a half to two hours to skateboard and I was 14. If there had been a park on the reserve, I would have been doing it there.”,Nations Skate Youth has visited Tsuut’ina Nation and Morley this week, and moves on to Maskwacis on July 23, Enoch Cree Nation July 24, Alexis Nakota Sioux Nation July 25 and Red Deer on July 26."
Parks Canada officials confirm euthanized wolf was behind Egypt Lake Campground incident,"Jul 21, 2020","The young, male wolf that was killed earlier this month due to its concerning behaviour near Sunshine Village is confirmed to be the same wolf responsible for entering multiple tents at the Egypt Lake Campground, according to Parks Canada officials.,At the beginning of July, the wolf had demonstrated food-conditioned behaviour near Sunshine Village and staff reported seeing it near Sunshine Road. Parks Canada staff captured the wolf while it was entering a storage building and an examination found the wolf had an “excessive level of habituation and human food conditioning,” which made it too dangerous to be released.,The wolf was euthanized and DNA samples were taken to compare its DNA to samples taken from Egypt Lake Campground, only 13 kilometres from the Sunshine sightings, where a wolf had entered multiple tents, leaving its DNA behind.,Parks Canada said in a statement Tuesday that the DNA results confirm the euthanized wolf was also responsible for the Egypt Lake Campground incident. As a result, the , in the Egypt Lake area have been lifted.,In an ,, Bill Hunt, resource conservation manager with Parks Canada, said the male wolf and a second wolf that was also euthanized this month were not known to park officials who closely monitor the Bow Valley pack. He said it’s a mystery where the two wolves originated from.,“This is highly unusual,” said Hunt. “Around the town of Banff, the last time we’ve had to do this was in 2016. So it’s odd these two incidents occurred within the same week. We can’t always speculate what that’s about.”,Parks Canada is reminding visitors and residents to do their part to protect the wolves in Banff National Park by always securing food and garbage, never feeding wildlife and reporting all wolf sightings to Banff Dispatch at 403-762-1470.,Twitter: "
